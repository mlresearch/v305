	abstract = {While large-scale robot datasets have propelled recent progress in imitation learning, learning from smaller task specific datasets remains critical for deployment in new environments and unseen tasks. One such approach to few-shot imitation learning is retrieval-based imitation learning, which extracts relevant samples from large, widely available prior datasets to augment a limited demonstration dataset. To determine the relevant data from prior datasets, retrieval-based approaches most commonly calculate a prior data point's minimum distance to a point in the target dataset in latent space. While retrieval-based methods have shown success using this metric for data selection, we demonstrate its equivalence to the limit of a Gaussian kernel density (KDE) estimate of the target data distribution. This reveals two shortcomings of the retrieval rule used in prior work. First, it relies on high-variance nearest neighbor estimates that are susceptible to noise. Second, it does not account for the distribution of prior data when retrieving data. To address these issues, we introduce Importance Weighted Retrieval (IWR), which estimates importance weights, or the ratio between the target and prior data distributions for retrieval, using Gaussian KDEs. By considering the probability ratio, IWR overcomes the bias of previous selection rules, and by using reasonable modeling parameters, IWR effectively smooths estimates using all data points.  Across both simulation environments and real-world evaluations on the Bridge dataset we find that our method, IWR, consistently improves performance of existing retrieval-based methods, despite only requiring minor modifications.}

While vision-language-action (VLA) models have demonstrated impressive results for end-to-end robot control, it remains an open question how far such models can generalize in the wild. We describe $\pi_{0.5}$, a new model based on $\pi_0$ that uses co-training on heterogeneous tasks to enable broad generalization. $\pi_{0.5}$ uses data from multiple robots, high-level semantic prediction, web data, and other sources to enable broadly generalizable real-world robotic manipulation. Our system uses a combination of co-training and hybrid multi-modal examples that combine image observations, language commands, object detections, semantic subtask prediction, and low-level actions. Our experiments show that this kind of knowledge transfer is essential for effective generalization, and we demonstrate for the first time that an end-to-end learning-enabled robotic system can perform long-horizon and dexterous manipulation skills, such as cleaning a kitchen or bedroom, in entirely new homes.}

    We introduce a red-teaming framework that probes robustness through object-centric geometric perturbations, automatically generating CrashShapes---structurally valid, user-constrained mesh deformations that trigger catastrophic failures in pre-trained manipulation policies. 
    The method integrates a Jacobian field--based deformation model with a gradient-free, simulator-in-the-loop optimization strategy.
    Across insertion, articulation, and grasping tasks, our approach consistently discovers deformations that collapse policy performance, revealing brittle failure modes missed by static benchmarks. 
    By combining task-level policy rollouts with constraint-aware shape exploration, we aim to build a general purpose framework for structured, object-centric robustness evaluation in robotic manipulation.
    We additionally show that fine-tuning on individual CrashShapes, a process we refer to as blue-teaming, improves task success by up to 60 percentage points on those shapes, while preserving performance on the original object, demonstrating the utility of red-teamed geometries for targeted policy refinement.
    Finally, we validate both red-teaming and blue-teaming results with a real robotic arm, observing that simulated CrashShapes reduce task success from 90\% to as low as 22.5\%, and that blue-teaming recovers performance to up to 90\% on the corresponding real-world geometry---closely matching simulation outcomes.}

	abstract = {Robots equipped with rich sensor suites can localize reliably in partially-observable environments---but powering every sensor continuously is wasteful and often infeasible. Belief-space planners address this by propagating pose-belief covariance through analytic models and switching sensors heuristically--a brittle, runtime expensive approach. Data-driven approaches--including diffusion models--learn multi-modal trajectories from demonstrations, but presuppose an accurate, always-on state estimate. We address the largely open problem: for a given task in a  mapped environment, which *minimal sensor subset* must be active at each location to maintain state uncertainty *just low enough* to complete the task? Our key insight is that when a diffusion planner is explicitly conditioned on a pose-belief raster and a sensor mask, the spread of its denoising trajectories yields a calibrated, differentiable proxy for the expected localization error. Building on this insight, we present Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion (B-COD), the first planner that, in a 10 ms forward pass, returns a short-horizon trajectory, per-waypoint aleatoric variances, and a proxy for localization error--eliminating external covariance rollouts. We show that this single proxy suffices for a soft-actor--critic to choose sensors online, optimising energy while bounding pose-covariance growth. We deploy B-COD in real-time marine trials on an unmanned surface vehicle and show that it reduces sensing energy consumption while matching the goal-reach performance of an always-on baseline.}

While prior systems often rely on flattening garments, humans routinely identify keypoints in highly crumpled and suspended states. We present a novel, task-agnostic, visuotactile framework that operates directly on crumpled clothing---including in-air configurations that have not been addressed before. Our approach combines global visual perception with local tactile feedback to enable robust, reactive manipulation. We train dense visual descriptors on a custom simulated dataset using a distributional loss that captures cloth symmetries and generates correspondence confidence estimates. These estimates guide a reactive state machine that dynamically selects between folding strategies based on perceptual uncertainty. In parallel, we train a visuotactile grasp affordance network using high-resolution tactile feedback to supervise grasp success. The same tactile classifier is used during execution for real-time grasp validation. Together, these components enable a reactive, task-agnostic framework for in-air garment manipulation, including folding and hanging tasks. Moreover, our dense descriptors serve as a versatile intermediate representation for other planning modalities, such as extracting grasp targets from human video demonstrations, paving the way for more generalizable and scalable garment manipulation.}

By leveraging self-supervised learning, TacX fuses these modalities into a unified representation that captures physical properties useful for downstream robot manipulation tasks. We study how to effectively integrate real-world touch representations for both imitation learning and tactile adaptation of sim-trained policies, showing that TacX boosts policy success rates by 63\% over an end-to-end model using tactile images and improves robustness by 90\% in recovering object states from touch. Finally, we benchmark TacX's ability to make inference about physical properties, such as object-action identification, material-quantity estimation and force estimation. TacX improves accuracy in characterizing physical properties by 48\% compared to end-to-end approaches, demonstrating the advantages of multisensory pretraining for capturing features essential for dexterous manipulation.}

We present *StackItUp*, a system that enables non-experts to specify complex 3D structures using only 2D front-view hand-drawn sketches. *StackItUp* introduces an abstract relation graph to bridge the gap between rough sketches and accurate 3D block arrangements, capturing the symbolic geometric relations (e.g., *left-of*) and stability patterns (e.g.,*two-pillar-bridge*) while discarding noisy metric details from sketches. It then grounds this graph to 3D poses using compositional diffusion models and iteratively updates it by predicting hidden internal and rear supports---critical for stability but absent from the sketch. Evaluated on sketches of iconic landmarks and modern house designs, *StackItUp* consistently produces stable, multilevel 3D structures and outperforms all baselines in both stability and visual resemblance.}

This is because most models are tied to a specific sensor design. To address this challenge, we propose two approaches to cross-sensor image generation. The first is an end-to-end method that leverages paired data (Touch2Touch). The second method builds an intermediate depth representation and does not require paired data (T2D2: Touch-to-Depth-to-Touch). Both methods enable the use of sensor-specific models across multiple sensors via the cross-sensor touch generation process. Together, these models offer flexible solutions for sensor translation, depending on data availability and application needs. We demonstrate their effectiveness on downstream tasks such as cup stacking and tool insertion, where models originally designed for one sensor are successfully transferred to another using in-hand pose estimation.}

While category-level and model-based approaches have achieved notable progress, they remain limited in generalizing to unseen objects under one-shot settings. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline for fast and accurate one-shot 6D pose and scale estimation. Leveraging recent advances in single-view 3D generation, we first build high-fidelity textured meshes without requiring known object poses. To resolve scale ambiguity, we introduce a coarse-to-fine alignment module that estimates both object size and initial pose by matching 2D-3D features with depth information. We then generate a diversified set of plausible 3D models using text-guided generative augmentation and render them with Blender to synthesize large-scale, domain-randomized training data for pose estiamtion. This synthetic data bridges the domain gap and enables robust fine-tuning of pose estimators. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on several 6D pose benchmarks, and we further validate its effectiveness on a newly collected in-the-wild dataset. Finally, we integrate our system with a dexterous hand, demonstrating its robustness in real-world robotic grasping tasks. All code, data, and models will be released to foster future research.}

A common approach in reinforcement learning (RL) is to penalize energy use directly in the reward function. This requires carefully weighting the reward terms to avoid undesirable trade-offs where energy minimization harms task success or vice versa. In this work, we propose a hyperparameter-free gradient optimization method to minimize energy without conflicting with task performance. Inspired by recent works in multitask learning, our method applies policy gradient projection between task and energy objectives to promote non-conflicting updates. We evaluate this technique on standard locomotion benchmarks of DM-Control and HumanoidBench and demonstrate a reduction of $64$\% energy usage while maintaining comparable task performance. Further, we conduct experiments on a Unitree GO2 quadruped showcasing Sim2Real transfer of energy efficient policies. Our method is easy to implement in standard RL pipelines with minimal code changes, and offers a principled alternative to reward shaping for energy efficient control policies.}

However, they are computationally expensive because they sample a *trajectory of trajectories*---a diffusion$/$flow trajectory of action trajectories. They discard intermediate action trajectories, and must wait for the sampling process to complete before any actions can be executed on the robot. We simplify diffusion$/$flow policies by *treating action trajectories as flow trajectories*. Instead of starting from pure noise, our algorithm samples from a narrow Gaussian around the last action. Then, it incrementally integrates a velocity field learned via flow matching to produce a sequence of actions that constitute a *single* trajectory. This enables actions to be streamed to the robot on-the-fly *during* the flow sampling process, and is well-suited for receding horizon policy execution. Despite streaming, our method retains the ability to model multi-modal behavior. We train flows that *stabilize* around demonstration trajectories to reduce distribution shift and improve imitation learning performance. Streaming flow policy outperforms prior methods while enabling faster policy execution and tighter sensorimotor loops for learning-based robot control.}

However, in scenarios where initial performance is not satisfactory, as is often the case in novel open-world settings, such behavioral cloning (BC)-learned policies typically require collecting additional human demonstrations to further improve their behavior---an expensive and time-consuming process. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) holds the promise of enabling autonomous online policy improvement, but often falls short of achieving this due to the large number of samples it typically requires. In this work we take steps towards enabling fast autonomous adaptation of BC-trained policies via efficient real-world RL. Focusing in particular on diffusion policies---a state-of-the-art BC methodology---we propose *diffusion steering via reinforcement learning* (DSRL): adapting the BC policy by running RL over its latent-noise space. We show that DSRL is highly sample efficient, requires only black-box access to the BC policy, and enables effective real-world autonomous policy improvement. Furthermore, DSRL avoids many of the challenges associated with finetuning diffusion policies, obviating the need to modify the weights of the base policy at all. We demonstrate DSRL on simulated benchmarks, real-world robotic tasks, and for adapting pretrained generalist policies, illustrating its sample efficiency and effective performance at real-world policy improvement.}

To overcome these challenges we present FORTRESS, a framework that generates and reasons about semantically safe fallback strategies in real time to prevent OOD failures. At a low frequency in nominal operations, FORTRESS uses multi-modal reasoners to identify goals and anticipate failure modes. When a runtime monitor triggers a fallback response, FORTRESS rapidly synthesizes plans to fallback goals while inferring and avoiding semantically unsafe regions in real time. By bridging open-world, multi-modal reasoning with dynamics-aware planning, we eliminate the need for hard-coded fallbacks and human safety interventions. FORTRESS outperforms on-the-fly prompting of slow reasoning models in safety classification accuracy on synthetic benchmarks and real-world ANYmal robot data, and further improves system safety and planning success in simulation and on quadrotor hardware for urban navigation.

In this paper, we introduce **ScrewSplat**, a simple end-to-end method that operates solely on RGB observations. Our approach begins by randomly initializing screw axes, which are then iteratively optimized to recover the object's underlying kinematic structure. By integrating with Gaussian Splatting, we simultaneously reconstruct the 3D geometry and segment the object into rigid, movable parts. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy across a diverse set of articulated objects, and further enables zero-shot, text-guided manipulation using the recovered kinematic model.}

In this work, we propose RoboArena, a new approach for scalable evaluation of generalist robot policies in the real world. Instead of standardizing evaluations around fixed tasks, environments, or locations, we propose to crowd-source evaluations across a distributed network of evaluators. Importantly, evaluators can freely choose the tasks and environments they evaluate on, enabling easy scaling of diversity, but they are required to perform double-blind evaluations over pairs of policies. Then, by aggregating preference feedback from pairwise comparisons across diverse tasks and environments, we can derive a ranking of policies. We instantiate our approach across a network of evaluators at seven academic institutions using the DROID robot platform. Through more than 600 pairwise real-robot evaluation episodes across seven generalist policies, we demonstrate that our crowd-sourced approach can more accurately rank the performance of existing generalist policies than conventional, centralized evaluation approaches, while being more scalable, resilient, and trustworthy. We open our evaluation network to the community and hope that it can enable more accessible comparisons of generalist robot policies.}

While such approaches have been shown to improve performance and generalization, they suffer from core limitations, like needing specialized robot reasoning data and slow inference speeds. To design new robot reasoning approaches that address these issues, a more complete characterization of why reasoning helps policy performance is critical. We hypothesize several mechanisms by which robot reasoning improves policies -- (1) better representation learning, (2) improved learning curricularization, and (3) increased expressivity -- then devise simple variants of robot CoT reasoning to isolate and test each one. We find that learning to generate reasonings does lead to better VLA representations, while attending to the reasonings aids in actually leveraging these features for improved action prediction. Our results provide us with a better understanding of why CoT reasoning helps VLAs, which we use to introduce two simple and lightweight alternative recipes for robot reasoning. Our proposed approaches achieve significant performance gains over non-reasoning policies, state-of-the-art results on the LIBERO-90 benchmark, and a 3x inference speedup compared to standard robot reasoning.}

	abstract = {We present Latent Theory of Mind (LatentToM), a decentralized diffusion policy architecture for collaborative robot manipulation. Our policy allows multiple manipulators with their own perception and computation to collaborate with each other towards a common task goal with or without explicit communication. Our key innovation lies in allowing each agent to maintain two latent representations: an ego embedding specific to the robot, and a consensus embedding trained to be common to both robots, despite their different sensor streams and poses. We further let each robot train a decoder to infer the other robot's ego embedding from their consensus embedding, akin to "theory of mind" in latent space. Training occurs centrally, with all the policies' consensus encoders supervised by a loss inspired by sheaf theory, a mathematical theory for clustering data on a topological manifold. Specifically, we introduce a first-order cohomology loss to enforce sheaf-consistent alignment of the consensus embeddings. To preserve the expressiveness of the consensus embedding, we further propose structural constraints based on theory of mind and a directional consensus mechanism. Execution can be fully distributed, requiring no explicit communication between policies. In which case, the information is exchanged implicitly through each robot's sensor stream by observing the actions of the other robots and their effects on the scene. Alternatively, execution can leverage direct communication to share the robots' consensus embeddings, where the embeddings are shared once during each inference step and are aligned using the sheaf Laplacian. While we tested our method using two manipulators, our approach can naturally be extended to an arbitrary number of agents. In our hardware experiments, LatentToM outperforms a naive decentralized diffusion baseline, and shows comparable performance with a state-of-the-art centralized diffusion policy for bi-manual manipulation. Additionally, we show that LatentToM is naturally robust to temporary robot failure or delays, while a centralized policy may fail.}

As a result, sim-to-real transfer has succeeded primarily in vision-based tasks, with multimodal transfer still largely unrealized. In this work, we tackle these challenges by introducing MultiGen, a framework that integrates large-scale generative models into traditional physics simulators, enabling multisensory simulation. We showcase our framework on the dynamic task of robot pouring, which inherently relies on multimodal feedback. By synthesizing realistic audio conditioned on simulation video, our method enables training on rich audiovisual trajectories---without any real robot data. We demonstrate effective zero-shot transfer to real-world pouring with novel containers and liquids, highlighting the potential of generative modeling to both simulate hard-to-model modalities and close the multimodal sim-to-real gap.}

Given an unseen task variation, ReWiND fine-tunes the pre-trained policy using the learned reward function, requiring minimal online interaction. We show that ReWiND's reward model generalizes effectively to unseen tasks, outperforming baselines by up to 2.4X in reward generalization and policy alignment metrics.

While traditional task planning methods are shown to be effective for long-horizon manipulation, they require discretizing the continuous state and action space into symbolic descriptions of objects, object relationships, and actions.
Our proposed method is instead able to take in a partially-observed point cloud observation of an initial scene and plan to a goal-satisfying configuration, without needing to discretize the set of actions or object relationships.
To enable this, we formulate the planning problem as an A* search over the space of possible point cloud rearrangements.
We sample point cloud transformations from a learned, domain-specific prior and then search for a sequence of such point cloud transformations that leads from the initial state to a goal.
We evaluate our method in terms of task planning success and task execution success on a real-world, multi-step table bussing environment and a simulation block stacking environment.
We experimentally demonstrate that our method produces successful plans and outperforms a policy-learning approach; we also perform ablations that show the importance of search in our approach.}

	abstract = {Robot-assisted feeding requires reliable bite acquisition, a challenging task due to the complex interactions between utensils and food with diverse physical properties. These interactions are further complicated by the temporal variability of food properties---for example, steak becomes firm as it cools even during a meal. To address this, we propose SAVOR, a novel approach for learning skill affordances for bite acquisition---how suitable a manipulation skill (e.g., skewering, scooping) is for a given utensil-food interaction. In our formulation, skill affordances arise from the combination of tool affordances (what a utensil can do) and food affordances (what the food allows). Tool affordances are learned offline through calibration, where different utensils interact with a variety of foods to model their functional capabilities. Food affordances are characterized by physical properties such as softness, moisture, and viscosity, initially inferred through commonsense reasoning using a visually-conditioned language model and then dynamically refined through online multi-modal visuo-haptic perception using SAVOR-Net during interaction. Our method integrates these offline and online estimates to predict skill affordances in real time, enabling the robot to select the most appropriate skill for each food item. Evaluated on 20 single-item foods and 10 in-the-wild meals, our approach improves bite acquisition success by 13\% over state-of-the-art (SOTA) category-based methods (e.g. use skewer for fruits). These results highlight the importance of modeling interaction-driven skill affordances for generalizable and effective robot-assisted bite acquisition.}

LocoFormer is able to adapt to changes in morphology and dynamics at test time. We find that two key choices enable adaptation. First, we train massive scale RL on procedurally generated robots with aggressive domain randomization. Second, in contrast to previous policies that are myopic with short context lengths, we extend context by orders of magnitude to span episode boundaries. We deploy the same LocoFormer to varied robots, and show robust control even with large disturbances such as weight and motor failures. In extreme scenarios, we see emergent adaptation across episodes, LocoFormer learns from falls in early episodes to improve control strategies in later ones. We believe this simple yet general recipe can be used to train foundation models for other robotic skills in the future. Videos at generalist-locomotion.github.io.}

We introduce Real2Render2Real (R2R2R), a novel approach for generating robot training data without relying on object dynamics simulation or teleoperation of robot hardware. The input is a smartphone-captured scan of one or more objects and a single video of a human demonstration. R2R2R renders thousands of high visual fidelity robot-agnostic demonstrations by reconstructing detailed 3D object geometry and appearance, and tracking 6-DoF object motion. R2R2R uses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to enable flexible asset generation and trajectory synthesis for both rigid and articulated objects, converting these representations to meshes to maintain compatibility with scalable rendering engines like IsaacLab but with collision-modeling turned off. Robot demonstration data generated by R2R2R integrates directly with models that operate on robot proprioceptive states and image observations, such as vision-language-action models (VLA) and imitation learning policies. Physical experiments suggest that models trained on R2R2R data from a single human demonstration can match the performance of models trained on 150 human teleoperation demonstrations.}

System Identification (Sys-ID) offers a targeted approach, but standard techniques rely on differentiable dynamics and/or direct torque measurement, assumptions that rarely hold for contact-rich legged systems. To this end, we present SPI-Active (Sampling-based Parameter Identification with Active Exploration), a two-stage framework that estimates physical parameters of legged robots to minimize the sim-to-real gap. SPI-Active robustly identifies key physical parameters through massive parallel sampling, minimizing state prediction errors between simulated and real-world trajectories. To further improve the informativeness of collected data, we introduce an active exploration strategy that maximizes the Fisher Information of the collected real-world trajectories via optimizing the input commands of an exploration policy. This targeted exploration leads to accurate identification and better generalization across diverse tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that SPI-Active enables precise sim-to-real transfer of learned policies to the real world, outperforming baselines by 42-63\% in various locomotion tasks.

In this work, we present DemoSpeedup, a self-supervised method to accelerate visuomotor policy execution via entropy-guided demonstration acceleration. DemoSpeedup starts from training an arbitrary generative policy (e.g., ACT or Diffusion Policy) on normal-speed demonstrations, which serves as a per-frame action entropy estimator. The key insight is that frames with lower action entropy estimates call for more consistent policy behaviors, which often indicate the demands for higher-precision operations. In contrast, frames with higher entropy estimates correspond to more casual sections, and therefore can be more safely accelerated. Thus, we segment the original demonstrations according to the estimated entropy, and accelerate them by down-sampling at rates that increase with the entropy values. Trained with the speedup demonstrations, the resulting policies execute up to 3 times faster while maintaining the task completion performance. Interestingly, these policies could even achieve higher success rates than those trained with normal-speed demonstrations, due to the benefits of reduced decision-making horizons.}

The key to our approach is an adaptive controller that seamlessly bridges the execution of manipulation motions and the generation of stable gaits based on task demands. Through the interplay between two controller modules, ReLIC dynamically assigns each limb for manipulation or locomotion and robustly coordinates them to achieve the task success. Using efficient reinforcement learning in simulation, ReLIC learns to perform stable gaits in accordance with the manipulation goals in the real world. To solve diverse and complex tasks, we further propose to interface the learned controller with different types of task specifications, including target trajectories, contact points, and natural language instructions. Evaluated on 12 real-world tasks that require diverse and complex coordination patterns, ReLIC demonstrates its versatility and robustness by achieving a success rate of 78.9\% on average.}

We present KineSoft, a framework enabling direct kinesthetic teaching of soft robotic hands by leveraging their natural compliance as a skill teaching advantage rather than only as a control challenge. KineSoft makes two key contributions: (1) an internal strain sensing array providing occlusion-free proprioceptive shape estimation, and (2) a shape-based imitation learning framework that uses proprioceptive feedback with a low-level shape-conditioned controller to ground diffusion-based policies. This enables human demonstrators to physically guide the robot while the system learns to associate proprioceptive patterns with successful manipulation strategies. We validate KineSoft through physical experiments, demonstrating superior shape estimation accuracy compared to baseline methods, precise shape-trajectory tracking, and higher task success rates compared to baseline imitation learning approaches. KineSoft's results demonstrate that embracing the inherent properties of soft robots leads to intuitive and robust dexterous manipulation capabilities.}

In this work, we propose a unified policy for legged robots that jointly models force and position control learned without reliance on force sensors. By simulating diverse combinations of active position and force commands alongside external disturbances force, we use reinforcement learning to learn a policy that estimates forces from the robot's historical states and compensates for them through position and velocity adjustments. Such a policy enables a wide range of manipulation behaviors under varying combinations of force and position inputs, including position tracking, force application, force tracking, and compliant robot behaviors. Additionally, we demonstrate that the learned policy enhances trajectory-based imitation learning pipelines by incorporating essential contact information through its force estimation module, achieving approximately ~39.5\% higher success rates across four challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks compared to position-control policies. Extensive experiments on both a quadrupedal mobile manipulation platform and a humanoid validate the versatility and robustness of the proposed policy across diverse scenarios.}

These rewards are used to train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy in simulation. The learned policy is then distilled into an image-conditioned diffusion policy using synthetic rollouts rendered with varied viewpoints and lighting.

Importantly, X-Sim does not require any robot teleoperation data. We evaluate it across 5 manipulation tasks in 2 environments and show that it: (1) improves task progress by 30\% on average over hand-tracking and sim-to-real baselines, (2) matches behavior cloning with 10x less data collection, and (3) generalizes to new camera viewpoints and test-time changes.}

	abstract = {Generalizable object fetching in cluttered scenes remains a fundamental and application-critical challenge in embodied AI. Closely packed objects cause inevitable occlusions, making safe action generation particularly difficult. Under such partial observability, effective policies must not only generalize across diverse objects and layouts but also reason about occlusion to avoid collisions. However, collecting large-scale real-world data for this task remains prohibitively expensive, leaving this problem largely unsolved. In this paper, we introduce FetchBot, a sim-to-real framework for this challenge. We first curate a large-scale synthetic dataset featuring 1M diverse scenes and 500k representative demonstrations. Based on this dataset, FetchBot employs a depth-conditioned method for action generation, which leverages structural cues to enable robust obstacle-aware action planning. However, depth is perfect in simulation but noisy in real-world environments. To address this sim-to-real gap, FetchBot predicts depth from RGB inputs using a foundation model and integrates local occupancy prediction as a co-training task, providing a generalizable latent representation for sim-to-real transfer. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments demonstrate FetchBot's strong zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, effective clutter handling, and adaptability to novel scenarios. In cluttered environments, it achieves an average success rate of 89.95\%, significantly outperforming prior methods. Moreover, FetchBot demonstrates excellent robustness in challenging cases, such as fetching transparent, reflective, and irregular objects, highlighting its practical value.}

Existing methods primarily focus on single-object grasping or grasp-pose prediction without interaction, which are insufficient for complex, cluttered scenes. Recent vision-language-action models offer a potential solution but require extensive real-world demonstrations, making them costly and difficult to scale. To address these limitations, we revisit the sim-to-real transfer pipeline and develop key techniques that enable zero-shot deployment in reality while maintaining robust generalization. We propose ClutterDexGrasp, a two-stage teacher-student framework for closed-loop target-oriented dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes. The framework features a teacher policy trained in simulation using clutter density curriculum learning, incorporating both a novel geometry- and spatially-embedded scene representation and a comprehensive safety curriculum, enabling general, dynamic, and safe grasping behaviors. Through imitation learning, we distill the teacher's knowledge into a student 3D diffusion policy (DP3) that operates on partial point cloud observations. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first zero-shot sim-to-real closed-loop system for target oriented dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes, demonstrating robust performance across diverse objects and layouts.}

Yet, standard methods make assumptions that limit their adoption in practice---for example, prior knowledge of the user's goals or the objective (i.e., reward) function that they wish to optimize, knowledge of the user's policy, or query-level access to the user during training. Diffusion-based approaches to shared autonomy do not make such assumptions and instead only require access to demonstrations of desired behaviors, while allowing the user to maintain control authority. However, these advantages have come at the expense of high computational complexity, which has made real-time shared autonomy all but impossible. To overcome this limitation, we propose Consistency Shared Autonomy (CSA), a shared autonomy framework that employs a consistency model-based formulation of diffusion. Key to CSA is that it employs the distilled probability flow of ordinary differential equations (PF ODE) to generate high-fidelity samples in a single step. This results in inference speeds significantly than what is possible with previous diffusion-based approaches to shared autonomy, enabling real-time assistance in complex domains with only a single function evaluation. Further, by intervening on flawed actions at intermediate states of the PF ODE, CSA enables varying levels of assistance. We evaluate CSA on a variety of challenging simulated and real-world robot control problems, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods both in terms of task performance and computational efficiency.}

In this work, we introduce the CLAMP device, a low-cost (< $200) sensorized reacher-grabber designed to collect large-scale, in-the-wild multimodal haptic data from non-expert users in everyday settings. We deployed 16 CLAMP devices to 41 participants, resulting in the CLAMP dataset, the largest open-source multimodal haptic dataset to date, comprising 12.3 million datapoints across 5357 household objects. Using this dataset, we train a haptic encoder that can infer material and compliance object properties from multimodal haptic data. We leverage this encoder to create the CLAMP model, a visuo-haptic perception model for material recognition that generalizes to novel objects and three robot embodiments with minimal finetuning. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in three real-world robot manipulation tasks: sorting recyclable and non-recyclable waste, retrieving objects from a cluttered bag, and distinguishing overripe from ripe bananas. Our results show that large-scale, in-the-wild haptic data collection can unlock new capabilities for generalizable robot manipulation.}

However, current methods often treat the solver and the neural network as separate, independent entities, leading to suboptimal integration. In this work, we propose a novel approach that co-develops the solver and architecture unifying the optimization solver and network inference problems. Specifically, we formulate this as a \textit{joint fixed-point problem} over the coupled network outputs and necessary conditions of the optimization problem. We solve this problem in an iterative manner where we alternate between network forward passes and optimization iterations. Through extensive ablations in various robotic control tasks, we demonstrate that our approach results in richer representations and more stable training, while naturally accommodating warm starting, a key requirement for MPC.}

To bridge this gap, we explore the feasibility of training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models entirely with large-scale synthetic action data.

This design helps mitigate sim-to-real gaps and facilitates the transfer of learned actions to a broader range of Internet-covered objects, achieving open-vocabulary generalization in grasping.

We evaluated our method with a rich library of four legged robots in both simulation and real-world experiments.

Such discrepancies generate unintended harmful forces, which, if exacerbated, may lead to task failure and potential damage to the manipulated objects or the robot itself. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel diffusion framework, termed SafeDiff. Unlike conventional methods that sequentially fuse visual and tactile data to predict future robot states, our approach generates a prospective state sequence based on the current robot state and visual context observations, using real-time force feedback as a calibration signal. 
This implicitly adjusts the robot's state within the state space, enhancing operational success rates and significantly reducing harmful forces during manipulation, thus ensuring manipulation force safety. Additionally, we develop a large-scale simulation dataset named SafeDoorManip50k, offering extensive multimodal data to train and evaluate the proposed method. Extensive experiments show that our visual-tactile model substantially mitigates the risk of harmful forces in the door opening task, across both simulated and real-world settings.}

Specifically, we use privileged actions in simulation with a general training procedure that would be infeasible to implement in real-world scenarios. These privileges include relaxed constraints and virtual forces that enhance interaction and exploration with objects. Our results successfully achieve complex multi-stage long-horizon tasks that naturally combine non-prehensile manipulation with grasping to lift objects from non-graspable poses. We demonstrate generality by maintaining a parsimonious reward structure and showing convergence to diverse and robust behaviors across various environments.

Existing RL methods struggle with task complexity, and collecting expert demonstrations is often impractical. Instead, inspired by human bimanual manipulation strategies, where two hands coordinate to stabilise and reorient objects, we focus on a bimanual robotic setup to tackle this challenge. In particular, we introduce Constraint-based Manipulation for Bimanual Occluded Grasping (COMBO-Grasp), an approach which leverages two coordinated policies: a constraint policy trained using self-supervised datasets to generate stabilising poses and a grasping policy trained using RL that reorients and grasps the target object. A key contribution lies in value function-guided policy coordination, where gradients from a jointly trained value function refine the constraint policy during RL training to improve bimanual coordination and task performance. Lastly, COMBO-Grasp employs teacher-student policy distillation to effectively deploy vision-based policies in real-world environments. Experiments show that COMBO-Grasp significantly outperforms baselines and generalises to unseen objects in both simulation and real environments.}

However, it remains unclear whether VLMs can reliably perform the complex spatiotemporal reasoning and intent inference needed for safe and socially compliant robot navigation. In this paper, we introduce the Social Navigation Scene Understanding Benchmark (SocialNav-SUB), a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs for scene understanding in real-world social robot navigation scenarios. SocialNav-SUB provides a unified framework for evaluating VLMs against human and rule-based baselines across VQA tasks requiring spatial, spatiotemporal, and social reasoning in social robot navigation.

	abstract = {Learning robot policies that capture multimodality in the training data has been a long-standing open challenge for behavior cloning. Recent approaches tackle the problem by modeling the conditional action distribution with generative models. One of these approaches is Diffusion Policy, which relies on a diffusion model to denoise random points into robot action trajectories. While achieving state-of-the-art performance, it has two main drawbacks that may lead the robot out of the data distribution during policy execution. First, the stochasticity of the denoising process can highly impact on the quality of generated trajectory of actions. Second, being a supervised learning approach, it can learn data outliers from the dataset used for training. Recent work focuses on mitigating these limitations by combining Diffusion Policy either with large-scale training or with classical behavior cloning algorithms. Instead, we propose KDPE, a Kernel Density Estimation-based strategy that filters out potentially harmful trajectories output of Diffusion Policy while keeping a low test-time computational overhead.
For Kernel Density Estimation, we propose a manifold-aware kernel to model a probability density function for actions composed of end-effector Cartesian position, orientation, and gripper state. KDPE overall achieves better performance than Diffusion Policy on simulated single-arm RoboMimic and MimicGen tasks, and on three real robot experiments:PickPlush, a tabletop grasping task, CubeSort, a multimodal pick and place task, and CoffeeMaking, a task that requires long-horizon capabilities and precise execution.

To address these challenges, we introduce the BEHAVIOR Robot Suite (BRS), a comprehensive framework for whole-body manipulation in diverse household tasks. Built on a bimanual, wheeled robot with a 4-DoF torso, BRS integrates a cost-effective whole-body teleoperation interface for data collection and a novel algorithm for learning whole-body visuomotor policies. We evaluate BRS on five challenging household tasks that not only emphasize the three core capabilities but also introduce additional complexities, such as long-range navigation, interaction with articulated and deformable objects, and manipulation in confined spaces.

Prior generative methods struggle to model the intricate grasp distribution of dexterous hands and often fail to reason about shape uncertainty inherent in partial point clouds, leading to unreliable or overly conservative grasps. We propose FFHFlow, a flow-based variational framework that generates diverse, robust multi-finger grasps while explicitly quantifying perceptual uncertainty in the partial point clouds. Our approach leverages a normalizing flow-based deep latent variable model to learn a hierarchical grasp manifold, overcoming the mode collapse and rigid prior limitations of conditional Variational Autoencoders (cVAEs). By exploiting the invertibility and exact likelihoods of flows, FFHFlow introspects shape uncertainty in partial observations and identifies novel object structures, enabling risk-aware grasp synthesis. To further enhance reliability, we integrate a discriminative grasp evaluator with the flow likelihoods, formulating an uncertainty-aware ranking strategy that prioritizes grasps robust to shape ambiguity. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world setups demonstrate that FFHFlow outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (including diffusion models) in grasp diversity and success rate, while achieving run-time efficient sampling. We also showcase its practical value in cluttered and confined environments, where diversity-driven sampling excels by mitigating collisions.}

In both cases, the robot must perceive the environment, update its belief, and accurately estimate potential information gain on-the-fly to guide planning. In this work, we propose CogniPlan, a novel path planning framework that leverages multiple plausible layouts predicted by a conditional generative inpainting model, mirroring how humans rely on cognitive maps during navigation. These predictions, based on the partially observed map and a set of layout conditioning vectors, enable our planner to reason effectively under uncertainty. We demonstrate strong synergy between generative image-based layout prediction and graph-attention-based path planning, allowing CogniPlan to combine the scalability of graph representations with the fidelity and predictiveness of occupancy maps, yielding notable performance gains in both exploration and navigation. We extensively evaluate CogniPlan on two datasets (hundreds of maps and realistic floor plans), consistently outperforming state-of-the-art planners. We further deploy it in a high-fidelity simulator and on hardware, showcasing its high-quality path planning and real-world applicability.}

	abstract = {Visual navigation using only a single camera and a topological map has recently become an appealing alternative to methods that require additional sensors and 3D maps. This is typically achieved through an "image-relative" approach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and subgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have limitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and embodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an embodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we present a new paradigm of learning "object-relative" control that exhibits several desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without strictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction problem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high invariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across both training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric map representation in the form of a relative" 3D scene graph, which is used to obtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train a local controller, dubbed "ObjectReact", conditioned directly on a high-level ``WayObject Costmap'' representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB input.
 We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative control over its image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple navigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding capability, e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction. We further show that our sim-only policy is able to generalize well to real-world indoor environments.}

A shared classifier passes LL feedback upstream so that sub-goals self-correct while sampling proceeds. This tight HL--LL coupling improves trajectory coherence and enables scalable long-horizon diffusion planning.

We exploit the property that the HJ value function can be expressed as a difference of the corresponding signed distance function (SDF) and a non-negative residual function. The residual component is modeled as a neural network with non-negative output and subtracted from the computed SDF, resulting in a real-time value function estimate that is at least as safe as the SDF by design. Additionally, we parametrize the neural residual by a hypernetwork to improve real-time performance and generalization properties.

Additionally, current Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches using a pose-based task specification lack the ability to directly control the end-effector velocity, making smoothly executing trajectories very challenging. To address these limitations, we propose an RL-based framework that allows for dynamic, velocity-aware whole-body end-effector control. Our method introduces a multi-critic actor architecture that decouples the reward signals for locomotion and manipulation, simplifying reward tuning and allowing the policy to resolve task conflicts more effectively. Furthermore, we design a twist-based end-effector task formulation that can track both discrete poses and motion trajectories. We validate our approach through a set of simulation and hardware experiments using a quadruped robot equipped with a robotic arm. The resulting controller can simultaneously walk and move its end-effector and shows emergent whole-body behaviors, where the base assists the arm in extending the workspace, despite a lack of explicit formulations.}

To address those challenges, we propose Adapt3R, a general-purpose 3D observation encoder which synthesizes data from calibrated RGBD cameras into a vector that can be used as conditioning for arbitrary IL algorithms.

Specifically, we first introduce a coordinate-based image builder that transforms GTSP instances into spatially informative representations. We then design an adaptive resolution scaling strategy to enhance adaptability across different problem scales, and develop a multimodal fusion module with dedicated bottlenecks that enables effective integration of geometric and spatial features. Extensive experiments show that our MMFL approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various GTSP instances while maintaining the computational efficiency required for real-time robotic applications.

However, existing neural architectures that support heterogeneous teaming tend to force a trade-off between expressivity and efficiency.
Shared-parameter designs prioritize sample efficiency by enabling a single network to be shared across all or a pre-specified subset of robots (via input augmentations), but tend to limit behavioral diversity. In contrast, recent designs employ a separate policy for each robot, enabling greater diversity and expressivity at the cost of efficiency and generalization. Our key insight is that such tradeoffs can be avoided by viewing these design choices as ends of a broad spectrum. Inspired by recent work in transfer and meta learning, and building on prior work in multi-robot task allocation, we propose Capability-Aware Shared Hypernetworks (CASH), a *soft weight sharing* architecture that uses hypernetworks to efficiently learn a *flexible* shared policy that dynamically adapts to each robot post-training. By explicitly encoding the impact of robot capabilities (e.g., speed and payload) on collective behavior, CASH enables *zero-shot generalization* to unseen robots or team compositions. Our experiments involve multiple heterogeneous tasks, three learning paradigms (imitation learning, value-based, and policy-gradient RL), and SOTA multi-robot simulation (JaxMARL) and hardware (Robotarium) platforms. Across all conditions, we find that CASH generates appropriately-diverse behaviors and consistently outperforms baseline architectures in terms of performance and sample efficiency during both training and zero-shot generalization, all with 60%-80\% fewer learnable parameters.}

Rather than discarding expert controllers, ReCoDe improves them by learning additional, dynamic constraints that capture subtler behaviors, for example, by constraining agent movements to prevent congestion in cluttered scenarios. Through local communication, agents collectively constrain their allowed actions to coordinate more effectively under changing conditions. In this work, we focus on applications of ReCoDe to multi-agent navigation tasks requiring intricate, context-based movements and consensus, where we show that it outperforms purely handcrafted controllers, other hybrid approaches, and standard MARL baselines. We give empirical (real robot) and theoretical evidence that retaining a user-defined controller, even when it is imperfect, is more efficient than learning from scratch, especially because ReCoDe can dynamically change the degree to which it relies on this controller.}

We propose the problem of predictive red teaming: discovering vulnerabilities of a policy with respect to environmental factors, and predicting the corresponding performance degradation without hardware evaluations in off-nominal scenarios. In order to achieve this, we develop RoboART: an automated red teaming (ART) pipeline that (1) modifies nominal observations using generative image editing to vary different environmental factors, and (2) predicts performance under each variation using a policy-specific anomaly detector executed on edited observations. Experiments across 500+ hardware trials in twelve off-nominal conditions for visuomotor diffusion policies demonstrate that RoboART predicts performance degradation with high accuracy (less than 0.19 average difference between predicted and real success rates). We also demonstrate how predictive red teaming enables targeted data collection: fine-tuning with data collected under conditions predicted to be adverse boosts baseline performance by 2--7x.}

In a multi-task policy evaluation setting, we actively model the distribution of robot performance across multiple tasks and policies as we sequentially execute experiments. We show that natural language is a useful prior in modeling relationships between tasks because they often share similarities that can reveal potential relationships in policy behavior. We leverage this formulation to reduce experimenter effort by using a cost-aware information gain heuristic to efficiently select informative trials. We conduct experiments on existing evaluation data from real robots and simulations and find a 50\% reduction in estimates of the mean performance given a fixed cost budget.

To address these challenges, we present SPARTA, a method for estimating approach angle conditioned traversability from point clouds. Specifically, we impose geometric structure into our network by outputting a smooth analytical function over the 1-Sphere that predicts risk distribution for any angle of approach with minimal overhead and can be reused for subsequent queries. The function is composed of Fourier basis functions, which has important advantages for generalization due to their periodic nature and smoothness.

To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling.

We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images.

Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario.

Yet, learning effective long-context policies from demonstrations remains challenging. 
As context length increases, training becomes increasingly expensive due to rising memory demands, and policy performance often degrades as a result of spurious correlations.
Recent methods typically sidestep these issues by truncating context length, discarding historical information that may be critical for subsequent decisions.
In this paper, we propose an alternative approach that explicitly regularizes the retention of past information.
We first revisit the copycat problem in imitation learning and identify an opposite challenge in recent diffusion policies: rather than over-relying on prior actions, they often fail to capture essential dependencies between past and future actions.
To address this, we introduce Past-Token Prediction (PTP), an auxiliary task in which the policy learns to predict past action tokens alongside future ones.
This regularization significantly improves temporal modeling in the policy head, with minimal reliance on visual representations.
Building on this observation, we further introduce a multistage training strategy: pre-train the visual encoder with short contexts, and fine-tune the policy head using cached long-context embeddings. 
This strategy preserves the benefits of PTP while greatly reducing memory and computational overhead.
Finally, we extend PTP into a self-verification mechanism at test time, enabling the policy to score and select candidates consistent with past actions during inference.
Experiments across four real-world and six simulated tasks demonstrate that our proposed method improves the performance of long-context diffusion policies by 3$\times$ and accelerates policy training by more than 10$\times$.

However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training data --- caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration challenges --- fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose QuaDreamer---the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos, providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller (SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE) -- a dual-stream architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency. We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes. The source code and model weights will be publicly available.}

These behaviors help humans reach their destinations efficiently by reducing the need to search through large areas. Existing robot navigation systems lack the ability to execute such behaviors and are thus highly inefficient at navigating within large environments. We present ReasonNav, a modular navigation system which integrates these human-like navigation skills by leveraging the reasoning capabilites of a vision-language model (VLM). We design compact input and output abstractions based on navigation landmarks, allowing the VLM to focus on language understanding and reasoning. We evaluate ReasonNav on real and simulated navigation tasks and show that the agent successfully employs higher-order reasoning to navigate efficiently in large, complex buildings.}

Existing zero-shot VLN methods are mainly designed for discrete environments or involve unsupervised training in continuous simulator environments, which makes it challenging to generalize and deploy them in real-world scenarios. To achieve a training-free framework in continuous environments, our framework formulates navigation guidance as graph constraint optimization by decomposing instructions into explicit spatial constraints. The constraint-driven paradigm decodes spatial semantics through constraint solving, enabling zero-shot adaptation to unseen environments. Specifically, we construct a spatial constraint library covering all types of spatial relationship mentioned in VLN instructions. The human instruction is decomposed into a directed acyclic graph, with waypoint nodes, object nodes and edges, which are used as queries to retrieve the library to build the graph constraints. The graph constraint optimization is solved by the constraint solver to determine the positions of waypoints, obtaining the robot's navigation path and final goal. To handle cases of no solution or multiple solutions, we construct the navigation tree and the backtracking mechanism. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in success rate and navigation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art zero-shot VLN methods. We further conduct real-world experiments to show our framework can effectively generalize to new environments and instruction sets, paving the way for more robust and autonomous navigation framework.}

In this work, we present Point Policy, a new method for learning robot policies exclusively from offline human demonstration videos without any teleoperation data. Point Policy leverages state-of-the-art vision models and policy architectures to translate human hand poses into robot poses while capturing object states through semantically meaningful key points. This approach yields a morphology-agnostic representation that facilitates effective policy learning. Through experiments on a diverse set of real-world tasks, we demonstrate that Point Policy significantly outperforms prior methods for policy learning from human videos, performing well not only within the training distribution but also generalizing to novel object instances and cluttered environments.

This critical problem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the robot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action propagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and solution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety, thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree (DiTree): a provably-generalizable framework leveraging diffusion policies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search within SBPs. DiTree  combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of expert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness of SBPs, to yield provably-safe solutions within a few action propagation iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler trained on a single environment. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD scenarios, DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (4x faster than classical SBPs), while improving the success rate over DP and SBPs (on average).}

While large-scale imitation pre-training shows promise, adapting these general-purpose policies to specific tasks in data-scarce settings remains unexplored. To achieve this, we propose ControlVLA, a novel framework that bridges pre-trained VLA models with object-centric representations via a ControlNet-style architecture for efficient fine-tuning. Specifically, to introduce object-centric conditions without overwriting prior knowledge, ControlVLA zero-initializes a set of projection layers, allowing them to gradually adapt the pre-trained manipulation policies.
In real-world experiments across 6 diverse tasks, including pouring cubes and folding clothes, our method achieves a 76.7\% success rate while requiring only 10-20 demonstrations --- a significant improvement over traditional approaches that require more than 100 demonstrations to achieve comparable success. 
Additional experiments highlight ControlVLA's extensibility to long-horizon tasks and robustness to unseen objects and backgrounds.}

In this paper, we present a highly sample-efficient, Koopman-based learning pipeline: Recursive Koopman Learning (RKL). We identify sufficient conditions for model convergence and provide formal algorithmic analysis supporting our claim that RKL is lightweight and fast, with complexity independent of dataset size. We validate our method on a simulated planar two-link arm and a hybrid nonlinear hardware system with soft actuators, showing that real-time recursive Koopman model updates improve the sample efficiency and stability of data-driven controller synthesis---requiring only <10\% of the data compared to benchmarks.

Bimanual robots---which also feature bilateral symmetry---should similarly exploit this property to perform tasks with either hand. Unlike humans, who often favor a dominant hand for fine dexterous skills, robots should ideally execute ambidextrous manipulation with equal proficiency. To this end, we introduce SYMDEX (SYMmetric DEXterity), a reinforcement learning framework for ambidextrous bi-manipulation that leverages the robot's inherent bilateral symmetry as an inductive bias. SYMDEX decomposes complex bimanual manipulation tasks into per-hand subtasks and trains dedicated policies for each. By exploiting bilateral symmetry via equivariant neural networks, experience from one arm is inherently leveraged by the opposite arm. We then distill the subtask policies into a global ambidextrous policy that is independent of the hand-task assignment. We evaluate SYMDEX on six challenging simulated manipulation tasks and demonstrate successful real-world deployment on two of them. Our approach outperforms baselines on more complex, asymmetric tasks, where the left and right hands perform different roles. We further demonstrate SYMDEX's scalability by extending it to a four-arm manipulation setup, where our symmetry-aware policies enable effective multi-arm collaboration and coordination. Our results highlight how structural symmetry as inductive bias in policy learning enhances sample efficiency, robustness, and generalization across diverse dexterous manipulation tasks.}

Evaluation of increasingly generalist robot policies requires an increasingly diverse repertoire of evaluation environments, making the evaluation bottleneck even more pronounced. To make real-world evaluation of robotic policies more practical, we propose AutoEval, a system to autonomously evaluate generalist robot policies around the clock with minimal human intervention. Users interact with AutoEval by submitting evaluation jobs to the AutoEval queue, much like how software jobs are submitted with a cluster scheduling system, and AutoEval will schedule the policies for evaluation within a framework supplying automatic success detection and automatic scene resets. We show that AutoEval can nearly fully eliminate human involvement in the evaluation process, permitting around the clock evaluations, and the evaluation results correspond closely to ground truth evaluations conducted by hand. To facilitate the evaluation of generalist policies in the robotics community, we provide public access to multiple AutoEval scenes in the popular BridgeData robot setup with WidowX robot arms. In the future, we hope that AutoEval scenes can be set up across institutions to form a diverse and distributed evaluation network.}

In this paper, we introduce a novel test-time computation framework that enhances VLMs' physical reasoning capabilities for multi-stage manipulation tasks. At its core, our approach iteratively improves a pretrained VLM with a ``reflection'' mechanism - it uses a generative model to imagine future world states, leverages these predictions to guide action selection, and critically reflects on potential suboptimalities to refine its reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art commercial VLMs as well as other post-training approaches such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).

To address this, we propose explicitly decoupling action generation from verification: we use an unconditional diffusion-based generator to propose multiple candidate actions and employ our history-aware verifier to select the most promising action by reasoning about past interactions.

This can help inform coarse, high level search and exploration strategies, even when such images lack sufficient resolution to allow fine-grained, explicit visual recognition of targets. However, there are some challenges to overcome with using satellite images to direct visual search. For one, targets that are unseen in satellite images are underrepresented (compared to real life) in most existing datasets, and thus vision models trained on these datasets fail to reason effectively based on indirect visual cues. Furthermore, approaches which leverage large Vision Language Models (VLMs) for generalization may yield inaccurate outputs due to hallucination, leading to inefficient search. To address these challenges, we introduce Search-TTA, a multimodal test-time adaptation framework that can accept text and/or image input. First, we pretrain a remote sensing image encoder to align with CLIP's visual encoder to output probability distributions of target presence used for visual search. Second, our framework dynamically refines CLIP's predictions during search using a test-time adaptation mechanism. Through a feedback loop inspired by Spatial Poisson Point Processes, gradient updates (weighted by uncertainty) are used to correct (potentially inaccurate) predictions and improve search performance. To validate Search-TTA's performance, we curate a visual search dataset based on internet-scale ecological data. We find that Search-TTA improves planner performance by up to 9.7\%, particularly in cases with poor initial CLIP predictions. It also achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art VLMs. Finally, we deploy Search-TTA on a real UAV via hardware-in-the-loop testing, by simulating its operation within a large-scale simulation that provides onboard sensing.}

We present KoopMotion which represents motion flow fields as dynamical systems, parameterized by Koopman Operators, and leverages the divergence properties of the learnt flow fields to obtain smooth motion fields that converge to a desired reference trajectory when the robot is placed away from the desired trajectory, and tracks the trajectory until the end point.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show evaluations of KoopMotion on the LASA human handwriting dataset, including spectral analysis.
We also perform experiments on a physical robot, verifying KoopMotion on a miniature autonomous surface vehicle operating in a non-static fluid flow environment.
Our approach is highly sample efficient in both space and time, requiring only 3\% of the LASA dataset to generate dense motion plans.
Additionally, KoopMotion provides a significant improvement over baselines when comparing metrics that measure spatial and temporal dynamics modeling efficacy.}

We introduce Reference-Scoped Exploration (RSE), a unified, single-loop optimization that integrates retargeting and tracking to train a scalable robot control policy directly from MoCap. Instead of treating demonstrations as strict ground truth, we view them as soft guidance. From raw demonstrations, we construct adaptive spatial scopes---time-varying termination boundaries, and reinforcement learning promotes the policy to stay within these envelopes while minimizing control effort. This holistic approach preserves demonstration intent, lets robot-specific strategies emerge, boosts robustness to noise, and scales effortlessly with large-scale demonstrations. We distill the scaled tracking policy into a vision-based, skill-conditioned generative control policy. This distilled policy captures diverse manipulation skills within a rich latent representation, enabling generalization across various objects and real-world robotic manipulation.}

Contemporary methods discover semantic subgoals embedded within the overall task, decomposing the overall task into tractable shorter-horizon goal-conditioned policy learning. However, policy deployment requires iteratively estimating $\textit{which}$ subgoal is being pursued and $\textit{when}$ it is achieved. We observe the brittleness of conventional $\textit{heuristic}$-based approaches (ad hoc threshold based), particularly for long-horizon imitation, since pursuing an incorrect subgoal can lead the robot policy to experience out of distribution states. In this work, we introduce two policy architectures for modeling subgoal transitions within a policy learning loop for long-horizon tasks. The first model autoregressively predicts the likelihood of the next subgoal transition, while the second uses cross-attention (via a transformer-based architecture) and implicitly models smooth and continuous transitions. We evaluate our models on $25$ simulated tasks on Franka Kitchen, $6$ real-world table-top tasks and $18$ simulated tasks on a new corpus (Franka-Long Horizon Tasks (LHT)) focused on tasks with rich object interactions over long episode lengths. Experimental results show significant improvements in learning efficacy, task success rates and generalization to out-of-distribution settings- extending horizon lengths for imitating manipulation tasks $\textit{from long to long(er)}$.}

Failure discovery, or falsification, is a widely used approach for evaluating robustness, with recent advancements focusing on improving sample efficiency and generalization through probabilistic sampling techniques and learning-theoretic approaches. However, existing methods typically rely on explicitly defined analytical cost functions to characterize failures, often overlooking the underlying causes and diversity of discovered failure scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel failure discovery framework that integrates contextual reasoning in the falsification process, specifically tailored for high evaluation-cost applications. Our method incorporates expert-in-the-loop feedback to construct a probabilistic surrogate model of failures using Bayesian inference. This model is iteratively refined and leveraged to guide an active learning strategy that prioritizes the discovery of diverse failure cases. We empirically validate our approach across a range of tasks for high-cost contextual falsification in robotic manipulation and autonomous driving.}

In this work, we introduce a general estimation framework that leverages *paired* data across test platforms, e.g., paired simulation and real-world observations, to achieve better estimates of real-world metrics via the method of control variates. By incorporating cheap and abundant auxiliary measurements (for example, simulator outputs) as control variates for costly real-world samples, our method provably reduces the variance of Monte Carlo estimates and thus requires significantly fewer real-world samples to attain a specified confidence bound on the mean performance. We provide theoretical analysis characterizing the variance and sample-efficiency improvement, and demonstrate empirically in autonomous driving and quadruped robotics settings that our approach achieves high-probability bounds with markedly reduced sample complexity. Our technique can lower the real-world testing burden for validating the performance of the stack, thereby enabling more efficient and cost-effective experimental evaluation of robotic systems.}

Magnetic tactile skins offer a flexible form factor for hand-wide coverage with fast response times, in contrast to vision-based tactile sensors that are restricted to the fingertips and limited by bandwidth. Full hand tactile perception is crucial for robot dexterity. However, a lack of general-purpose models, challenges with interpreting magnetic flux and calibration have limited the adoption of these sensors.
PercepSkin, given a history of kinematic and tactile sensing across a hand, outputs a latent tactile embedding that can be used in any downstream task. The encoder is self-supervised via self-distillation on a variety of unlabeled hand-object  interactions using an Allegro hand sensorized with Xela uSkin.
In experiments across several benchmark tasks, from state estimation to policy learning, we find that pretrained PercepSkin representations are both sample efficient in learning downstream tasks and improve task performance by over 41% compared to prior work and over 56% compared to end-to-end learning.}

We identify that conventional link-level reward formulations fail to induce true whole-body rotation and introduce a centroidal angular velocity reward that accurately captures system-wide rotational dynamics. To bridge the sim-to-real gap under extreme conditions, we model motor operating regions (MOR) and apply transmission load regularization to ensure realistic torque commands and mechanical robustness. Using the one-leg hopper front flip as a representative case study, we demonstrate the first successful hardware realization of a full front flip. Our results highlight that incorporating centroidal dynamics and actuator constraints is critical for reliably executing highly dynamic motions.}

However, these models struggle to reason about 3D spatial relationships from 2D image inputs. Although an increasing number of 3D approaches explicitly integrate 3D information, they encounter challenges such as limited availability of large-scale 3D datasets and loss of spatial information during input processing. Meanwhile, existing policies typically focus on the perception-to-action learning paradigm, lacking an explicit understanding of the spatial and temporal relationships between the robot and its environment. To address this, we propose 3DS-VLA, which enhances pretrained 2D vision-language models (VLMs) with comprehensive 3D awareness, enabling the prediction of robust end-effector poses.
Specifically, we enable a 2D vision encoder to encode both 2D images and 3D spatial observation by introducing a 2D-to-3D positional alignment mechanism. This allows 3DS-VLA to leverage the large-scale pre-trained knowledge of the VLM for effective reasoning in complex 3D robotic environments. Furthermore, to better understand the spatiotemporal relationship between 3D observations and robot behavior, we guide the model to learn the introduced sequential 3D spatial constraints, which define affordance-relevant 3D keypoints on objects, ensuring robust interactions. Experiments in simulated and real-world demonstrate that 3DS-VLA outperforms previous state-of-the-art policies and showcase its generalizable capabilities across multi-task, multi-embodiment, and diverse environmental settings.}

Our pipeline first processes the robot's image view to identify human poses and key environmental features. It then encodes the planned 3D spatial trajectory (including velocity and force) onto this view, visually grounding the path and its dynamics. CoRI queries a vision-language model with this visual representation to interpret the planned action within the visual context before generating concise, user-directed statements, without relying on task-specific information. Results from a user study involving robot-assisted feeding, bathing, and shaving tasks across two different robots indicate that CoRI leads to statistically significant difference in communication clarity compared to a baseline communication strategy.

Existing methods are either confined to simple, predefined scenarios or restricted to task-specific data distributions at training, limiting their support for real-world assistance.
We introduce Casper, an assistive teleoperation system that leverages commonsense knowledge embedded in pre-trained visual language models (VLMs) for real-time intent inference and flexible skill execution. Casper incorporates an open-world perception module for a generalized understanding of novel objects and scenes, a VLM-powered intent inference mechanism that leverages commonsense reasoning to interpret snippets of teleoperated user input, and a skill library that expands the scope of prior assistive teleoperation systems to support diverse, long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks. Extensive empirical evaluation, including human studies and system ablations, demonstrates that Casper improves task performance, reduces human cognitive load, and achieves higher user satisfaction than direct teleoperation and assistive teleoperation baselines.

This policy is then transferred to a simulated digital twin equipped with simulated tactile sensors and further refined via large-scale reinforcement learning to enhance robustness and generalization. To enable accurate sim-to-real transfer, we leverage high-resolution piezoresistive tactile sensors that provide normal force signals and can be realistically modeled in parallel using GPU-accelerated simulation. Experimental results show that VT-Refine improves assembly performance in both simulation and the real world by increasing data diversity and enabling more effective policy fine-tuning.

In this work, we leverage 2D keypoints --- spatially consistent features in the image frame --- as a state representation for robust policy learning, and apply it to both sim-to-real transfer and real-world imitation learning.

We distill expert data (either from an expert policy in simulation or a human expert) into a policy that operates on RGB images while tracking the selected keypoints. By leveraging pre-trained visual modules, our system effectively tracks keypoints and transfers policies to the real-world evaluation scenario, even given perceptual challenges like transparent objects or fine-grained manipulation, or widely varying scene appearance.

Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, on the other hand, have shown some success in high-precision assembly, but suffer from sample inefficiency, which limits their effectiveness in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical modular approach, named Adaptive Robotic Compositional Hierarchy (ARCH), which enables long-horizon, high-precision robotic assembly in contact-rich settings. ARCH employs a hierarchical planning framework, including a low-level primitive library of parameterized skills and a high-level policy. The low-level primitive library includes essential skills for assembly tasks, such as grasping and inserting. These primitives consist of both RL and model-based controllers. The high-level policy, learned via IL from a handful of demonstrations, without the need for teleoperation, selects the appropriate primitive skills and instantiates them with input parameters. We extensively evaluate our approach in simulation and on a real robotic manipulation platform. We show that ARCH generalizes well to unseen objects and outperforms baseline methods in terms of success rate and data efficiency.}

During navigation, robot teams usually need to maintain specific formations, such as circular formations to protect human teammates at the center. 
However, in complex scenarios such as narrow corridors, rigidly preserving predefined formations can become infeasible. 
Therefore, robot teams must be capable of dynamically splitting into smaller subteams and adaptively controlling the subteams to navigate through such scenarios while preserving formations.
To enable this capability, we introduce a novel method for SubTeaming and Adaptive Formation (STAF), which is built upon a unified hierarchical learning framework:
(1) high-level deep graph cut for team splitting, (2) intermediate-level graph learning for facilitating coordinated navigation among subteams, 
and (3) low-level policy learning for controlling individual mobile robots to reach their goal positions while avoiding collisions.

	abstract = {Exploration is crucial for legged robots to learn agile locomotion behaviors capable of overcoming diverse obstacles. 
For example, a robot may need to try different contact patterns and momentum profiles to successfully jump over an obstacle---but encouraging such diverse exploration is inherently challenging. As a result, training these behaviors often relies on additional techniques such as extensive reward engineering, expert demonstrations, or curriculum learning. However, these approaches limit generalizability, especially when prior knowledge or demonstration data is unavailable.
In this work, we propose using unsupervised skill discovery as a skill-level exploration strategy to significantly reduce human engineering effort. Our learning framework enables the agent to autonomously discover diverse skills to overcome complex obstacles. To dynamically regulate the degree of exploration throughout training, we introduce a bi-level optimization process that learns a parameter to balance two distinct reward signals. We demonstrate that our method enables quadrupedal robots to acquire highly agile behaviors---including crawling, climbing, leaping, and complex maneuvers such as jumping off vertical walls. Finally, we successfully deploy the learned policy on real hardware, validating its transferability to the real world.}

While teleoperation is widely used, it is slow, delay-sensitive, and poorly suited for dynamic tasks. In contrast, human videos provide a natural way for data collection without specialized hardware, though they pose challenges on robot learning due to viewpoint variations and embodiment gaps. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that transfers tool-use knowledge from humans to robots. To improve the policy's robustness to viewpoint variations, we use two RGB cameras to reconstruct 3D scenes and apply Gaussian splatting for novel view synthesis. We reduce the embodiment gap using segmented observations and tool-centric, task-space actions to achieve embodiment-invariant visuomotor policy learning. Our method achieves a 71\% improvement in task success and a 77\% reduction in data collection time compared to diffusion policies trained on teleoperation with equivalent time budgets. Our method also reduces data collection time by 41\% compared with the state-of-the-art data collection interface.}

Aiming to address these limitations, we propose GraphEQA, a novel approach that utilizes real-time 3D metric-semantic scene graphs (3DSGs) and task relevant images as multi-modal memory for grounding Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to perform EQA tasks in unseen environments. We employ a hierarchical planning approach that exploits the hierarchical nature of 3DSGs for structured planning and semantic-guided exploration. We evaluate GraphEQA in simulation on two benchmark datasets, HM-EQA and OpenEQA, and demonstrate that it outperforms key baselines by completing EQA tasks with higher success rates and fewer planning steps, and further demonstrate GraphEQA in two separate real world environments.

However, methods for interpreting and steering VLAs fall far short of classical robotics pipelines, which are grounded in explicit models of kinematics, dynamics, and control. This lack of mechanistic insight is a central challenge for deploying learned policies in real-world robotics, where robustness and explainability are critical. Motivated by advances in mechanistic interpretability for large language models, we introduce the first framework for interpreting and steering VLAs via their internal representations, enabling direct intervention in model behavior at inference time. We project feedforward activations within transformer layers onto the token embedding basis, identifying sparse semantic directions - such as speed and direction - that are causally linked to action selection. Leveraging these findings, we introduce a general-purpose activation steering method that modulates behavior in real time, without fine-tuning, reward signals, or environment interaction. We evaluate this method on two recent open-source VLAs, Pi0 and OpenVLA, and demonstrate zero-shot behavioral control in simulation (LIBERO) and on a physical robot (UR5). This work demonstrates that interpretable components of embodied VLAs can be systematically harnessed for control---establishing a new paradigm for transparent and steerable foundation models in robotics.}

For efficient large-area tactile sensing, we design a high-density distributed tactile sensor that covers the entire back of the robot. To effectively leverage tactile feedback for robot control, we develop a simulation environment with high-fidelity tactile signals, and train tactile-aware transport policies using a two-stage learning pipeline. Furthermore, we design a novel reward function to promote robust, symmetric, and frequency-adaptive locomotion gaits. After training in simulation, LocoTouch transfers zero-shot to the real world, reliably transporting a wide range of unsecured cylindrical objects with diverse sizes, weights, and surface properties. Moreover, it remains robust over long distances, on uneven terrain, and under severe perturbations.}

Having precise estimations and uncertainties plays a crucial role in planning and control algorithms to explore safe and reliable maneuver strategies. However, existing approaches, such as Gaussian Processes (GPs) and neural network-based methods, often fail to meet these needs. They are either unable to perform in real-time due to high computational demands, underestimating sharp geometry changes, or harming elevation accuracy when learned with uncertainties. Recently, Neural Processes (NPs) have emerged as a promising approach that integrates the Bayesian uncertainty estimation of GPs with the efficiency and flexibility of neural networks. Inspired by NPs, we propose an effective NP-based method that precisely estimates sharp elevation changes and quantifies the corresponding predictive uncertainty without losing elevation accuracy. Our method leverages semantic features from LiDAR and camera sensors to improve interpolation and extrapolation accuracy in unobserved regions. Also, we introduce a local ball-query attention mechanism to effectively reduce the computational complexity of global attention by 17\% while preserving crucial local and spatial information. We evaluate our method on off-road datasets having interesting geometric features, collected from trails, deserts, and hills. Our results demonstrate superior performance over baselines and showcase the potential of neural processes for effective and expressive terrain modeling in complex off-road environments.}

We then train a human-humanoid behavior policy, which we term Human Action Transformer (HAT). The state-action space of HAT is unified for both humans and humanoid robots and can be differentiably retargeted to robot actions.

Inspired by the theory of influence functions, we propose CUPID. Given a set of evaluation rollouts, CUPID estimates the influence of a training demonstration on the policy's expected return. This enables ranking and selection of demonstrations according to their impact on the policy's closed-loop performance. We use our estimator to curate data by 1) filtering out training demonstrations that harmed the policy's performance and 2) subselecting newly collected trajectories that will most help improve the policy. Extensive simulated and hardware experiments show that our approach consistently identifies which data drives test-time performance. For example, training with less than 33\% of curated data can result in state-of-the-art diffusion policies on the simulated Robomimic benchmark, and we observe similar improvements in hardware experiments. Furthermore, our hardware experiments show that our influence-based estimator can identify robust strategies under distribution shift, isolate spurious correlations, and even enhance post-training of generalist policies.}

Conventional mobile manipulation approaches often struggle to generalize across different tasks and environments due to the lack of large-scale training. However, recent advances in manipulation foundation models demonstrate impressive generalization capability on a wide range of fixed-base manipulation tasks, which are still limited to a fixed setting. Therefore, we devise a plug-in module named MoTo, which can be combined with any off-the-shelf manipulation foundation model to empower them with mobile manipulation ability. Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware navigation policy to generate agent docking points for generalized mobile manipulation.  To enable zero-shot ability, we propose an interaction keypoints framework via vision-language models (VLM) under multi-view consistency for both target object and robotic arm following instructions, where fixed-base manipulation foundation models can be employed. We further propose motion planning objectives for the mobile base and robot arm, which minimize the distance between the two keypoints and maintain the physical feasibility of trajectories. In this way, MoTo guides the agent to move to the docking points where fixed-base manipulation can be successfully performed, and leverages VLM generation and trajectory optimization to achieve mobile manipulation in a zero-shot manner, without any requirement on mobile manipulation expert data. Extensive experimental results on OVMM and real-world demonstrate that MoTo achieves success rates of 2.68% and 16.67% higher than the state-of-the-art mobile manipulation methods, respectively, without requiring additional training data.}

However, practical demonstrations are often incomplete or unrealistic, causing current methods to boost style at the expense of task performance. To address this issue, we propose formulating the problem as a  constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). Our approach integrates a style-imitation objective with constraints to maintain near-optimal task performance. We introduce an adaptively adjustable Lagrangian multiplier to guide the agent to imitate demonstrations selectively, capturing stylistic nuances without compromising task performance. We validate our approach across multiple robotic platforms and tasks, demonstrating both robust task performance and high-fidelity style learning. On ANYmal-D hardware we show a 14.5\% drop in mechanical energy and a more agile gait pattern, showcasing real-world benefits.}

Direct RL in the real world demands both safe exploration and high sample efficiency, which are difficult to achieve in practice. Sim-to-real RL, on the other hand, is often brittle due to the reality gap. This paper introduces SLAC, a method that renders real-world RL feasible for complex embodiments by leveraging a low-fidelity simulator to pretrain a task-agnostic latent action space. SLAC trains this latent action space via a customized unsupervised skill discovery method designed to promote temporal abstraction, disentanglement, and safety, thereby facilitating efficient downstream learning. Once a latent action space is learned, SLAC uses it as the action interface for a novel off-policy RL algorithm to autonomously learn downstream tasks through real-world interactions. We evaluate SLAC against existing methods on a suite of bimanual mobile manipulation tasks, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, SLAC learns contact-rich whole-body tasks in under an hour of real-world interactions, without relying on any demonstrations or hand-crafted behavior priors.}

This paper proposes ZipMPC, a method that imitates a long-horizon MPC behaviour by learning a compressed and context-dependent cost function for a short-horizon MPC. It improves performance over alternative methods, such as approximate explicit MPC and automatic cost parameter tuning, in particular in terms of i) optimizing the long-term objective; ii) maintaining computational costs comparable to a short-horizon MPC; iii) ensuring constraint satisfaction; and iv) generalizing control behaviour to environments not observed during training. For this purpose, ZipMPC leverages the concept of differentiable MPC with neural networks to propagate gradients of the imitation loss through the MPC optimization. We validate our proposed method in simulation and real-world experiments on autonomous racing. ZipMPC consistently completes laps faster than selected baselines, achieving lap times close to the long-horizon MPC baseline. In challenging scenarios where the short-horizon MPC baseline fails to complete a lap, ZipMPC is able to do so. In particular, these performance gains are also observed on tracks unseen during training.}

While there are many approaches to approximately solving POMDPs, we aim to address the problem of learning such models. In particular, we are interested in a subclass of POMDPs wherein the components of the model, including the observation function, reward function, transition function, and initial state distribution function, can be modeled as low-complexity probabilistic graphical models in the form of a short probabilistic program. Our strategy to learn these programs uses an LLM as a prior, generating candidate probabilistic programs that are then tested against the empirical distribution and adjusted through feedback. We experiment on a number of classical toy POMDP problems, simulated MiniGrid domains, and two real mobile-base robotics search domains involving partial observability. Our results show that using an LLM to guide in the construction of a low-complexity POMDP model can be more effective than tabular POMDP learning, behavior cloning, or direct LLM planning.}

In this work, we make a key observation that long range navigation only necessitates identifying good frontier directions for planning instead of full map knowledge. To address this, we introduce Long Range Navigator (LRN), which learns to predict affordable' frontier directions from high-dimensional camera images. LRN is trained entirely on unlabeled egocentric videos, making it scalable and adaptable. In off-road tests on Spot and a large vehicle, LRN reduces human interventions and improves decision speed when integrated into existing navigation stacks.}

However, these models exhibit diverse failure modes in unstructured real-world environments, limiting the widespread adoption of VLAs in robotics. Efforts to enhance the robustness and generalization of VLAs have gradually shifted from the pre-training to the post-training phase. Yet, the potential of scaling test-time compute remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate test-time scaling for robotics through the lens of sampling and verification. We first demonstrate that the relationship between action error and the number of generated samples follows an exponentiated power law across a range of VLAs, indicating the existence of inference-time scaling laws. Building on this insight, we propose a synthetic data generation pipeline for training a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based action verifier, and show that scaling the synthetic dataset consistently improves verification and downstream accuracy. We then introduce RoboMonkey, a test-time scaling framework for VLAs. At deployment, RoboMonkey samples a small set of actions from a VLA, applies Gaussian perturbations and majority voting to construct an action proposal distribution, and then uses the VLM-based verifier to select the optimal action. Through extensive evaluations across simulated and real-world environments, we show that pairing existing VLAs with RoboMonkey yields significant performance gains, achieving a 25\% absolute improvement on out-of-distribution tasks and 8\% higher average success rate on in-distribution tasks. Additionally, when adapting to new robot setups, we show that fine-tuning both VLAs and action verifiers yields a 7\% performance increase compared to fine-tuning VLAs alone.}

Recent diffusion-based policy learning approaches have achieved promising performance in modeling action distributions for bimanual manipulation. However, they ignored the physical safety constraints of bimanual manipulation, which leads to the dangerous behaviors with damage to robots and objects.  To this end, we propose a test-time trajectory optimization framework named SafeBimanual for any pre-trained diffusion-based bimanual manipulation policies, which imposes the safety constraints on bimanual actions to avoid dangerous robot behaviors with improved success rate. Specifically, we design diverse cost functions for safety constraints in different dual-arm cooperation patterns including avoidance of tearing objects and collision between arms and objects, which optimizes the manipulator trajectories with guided sampling of diffusion denoising process. Moreover, we employ a vision-language model (VLM) to schedule the cost functions by specifying keypoints and corresponding pairwise relationship, so that the optimal safety constraint is dynamically generated in the entire bimanual manipulation process. SafeBimanual demonstrates superiority on 8 simulated tasks in RoboTwin with a 11.1\% increase in success rate and a 18.9\% reduction in unsafe interactions over state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world tasks further verify its practical value by improving the success rate by 32.5\%.}

However, they often struggle to generalize beyond the distribution of their training data. In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of this limited generalization capability.  We identify shortcut learning---the reliance on task-irrelevant features---as a key impediment to generalization. Through comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we uncover two primary contributors to shortcut learning: (1) limited diversity within individual sub-datasets, and (2) significant distributional disparities across sub-datasets, leading to dataset fragmentation. These issues arise from the inherent structure of large-scale datasets like OXE, which are typically composed of multiple sub-datasets collected independently across varied environments and embodiments. Our findings provide critical insights into dataset collection strategies that can reduce shortcut learning and enhance the generalization ability of generalist robot policies. Moreover, in scenarios where acquiring new large-scale data is impractical, we demonstrate that carefully selected robotic data augmentation strategies can effectively reduce shortcut learning in existing offline datasets, thereby improving generalization capabilities of generalist robot policies, e.g., $\pi_0$ in the SIMPLER Environment.}

HALO learns a reward model from offline data, leveraging expert trajectories collected from mobile robots. During training, actions are randomly sampled from the action space around the expert action and ranked using a Boltzmann probability distribution that combines their distance to the expert action with human preference scores derived from intuitive navigation queries based on the corresponding egocentric camera feed. These scores establish preference rankings, enabling the training of a novel reward model based on Plackett-Luce loss, which allows for preference-driven navigation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of HALO, we deploy its reward model in two downstream applications: (i) an offline learned policy trained directly on the HALO-derived rewards, and (ii) a model-predictive-control (MPC) based planner that incorporates the HALO reward as an additional cost term. This showcases the versatility of HALO across both learning-based and classical navigation frameworks. Our real-world deployments on a Clearpath Husky across multiple scenarios demonstrate that policies trained with HALO achieve improved performance over state-of-the-art methods in terms of success rate and normalized trajectory length while maintaining lower Fr\'{e}chet distance with the human expert trajectories.}

This framework constructs a forward prediction model with contrastive learning, incorporating a comparator and a forward model. The forward model predicts the robot's subsequent state, and the comparator compares these predictions with actual states to generate critical prediction errors. These errors are systematically integrated into the controller, facilitating the continuous adjustment and refinement of control signals.Experiments on quadruped robots across different terrains and various joint damage scenarios have verified the effectiveness of our method, especially the functions of the comparator and the forward model. Furthermore, robots can adapt to locked joints without prior training, demonstrating zero-shot transfer capability. Finally, the proposed method demonstrates universal applicability to both quadruped and hexapod robots, highlighting its potential for broader applications in legged robotics.}

Training data is collected by a pair of robots moving randomly without needing external infrastructure or human supervision.
Our model trains on the task of predicting from an image the state of each LED on the robot.
In doing so, it learns to predict the position of the robot in the image, its distance, and its relative bearing.
At inference time, the state of the LEDs is unknown, can be arbitrary, and does not affect the pose estimation performance.
Quantitative experiments indicate that our approach: is competitive with SoA approaches that require supervision from pose labels or a CAD model of the robot; generalizes to different domains; and handles multi-robot pose estimation.}

To tackle this, we introduce ImLPR, a novel pipeline that employs a pre-trained DINOv2 VFM to generate rich descriptors for LPR. To our knowledge, ImLPR is the first method to leverage a VFM to support LPR. ImLPR converts raw point clouds into Range Image Views (RIV) to leverage VFM in the LiDAR domain.

We validate ImLPR using public datasets where it outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in intra-session and inter-session LPR with top Recall@1 and F1 scores across various LiDARs.

Moreover, it produces high-quality and diverse action trajectories within 1-2 steps on a set of real-world robot tasks.

The long denoising sequence for each action prediction impedes effective reward propagation. Additionally, standard RL methods require millions of physical interaction steps, making fine-tuning even more challenging. Prior work models the denoising steps in diffusion policies as a Markov Decision Process to adapt to RL policy updates, but its heavy reliance on environment interactions still leads to inefficiency. To bridge this gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for fine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement learning. Unlike model-free approaches that require millions of environment interactions to fine-tune a repertoire of robot skills, DiWA achieves effective adaptation using a world model trained once on a few hundred thousand offline play interactions. This results in dramatically improved sample efficiency, making the approach significantly more practical and safer for real-world robot learning. On the challenging CALVIN benchmark, DiWA improves performance across eight tasks using only offline adaptation, while requiring orders of magnitude fewer physical interactions than model-free baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of fine-tuning diffusion policies for real-world robotic skills using an offline world model. We make the code publicly available at _redacted-for-review_.}

This is applied to two control tasks using a pair of low-cost desktop robotic arms equipped with a vision-based tactile sensor: first, a tactile tracking task, where a follower arm tracks a surface moved by the leader arm; second, a collaborative co-lift task, where both arms jointly hold an object while the leader arm moves along a prescribed trajectory. Our method maintain contact errors within 1-2 mm across varied trajectories where shear sensing is essential for task performance.

However, the community currently lacks a clear and common benchmark that can evaluate how well VLMs can aid low-level reasoning in robotics. Consequently, we propose a novel benchmark, ManipBench, to evaluate the low-level robot manipulation reasoning capabilities of VLMs across various dimensions, including how well they understand object-object interactions and deformable object manipulation. We extensively test 35 common and state-of-the-art VLM families on our benchmark, including variants to test different model sizes. The performance of VLMs significantly varies across tasks, and there is a strong correlation between this performance and trends in our real-world manipulation tasks.

To address these challenges, we propose Distributed Upload and Active Labeling (DUAL), a decentralized, two-stage data collection framework for resource-constrained robotic fleets. In the first stage, each robot independently selects a subset of its local observations to upload under storage and communication constraints. In the second stage, the cloud selects a subset of uploaded data to label, subject to a global annotation budget. We evaluate DUAL on classification tasks spanning multiple sensing modalities, as well as on RoadNet---a real-world dataset we collected from vehicle-mounted cameras for time and weather classification. We further validate our approach in a physical experiment using a Franka Emika Panda robot arm, where it learns to move a red cube to a green bowl. Finally, we test DUAL on trajectory prediction using the nuScenes autonomous driving dataset to assess generalization to complex prediction tasks. Across all settings, DUAL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 31.1\% gain in classification accuracy and a 13\% improvement in real-world robotics task completion rates.}

To explore this, we procedurally generate a dataset of $\sim$1,000 varied robot embodiments, spanning humanoids, quadrupeds, and hexapods, and train embodiment-specific reinforcement learning experts for legged locomotion. We then distill these experts into a single generalist policy capable of handling diverse observation and action spaces. Our large-scale study reveals that generalization performance improves with the number of training embodiments. Notably, a policy trained on the full dataset zero-shot transfers to diverse unseen embodiments in both simulation and real-world evaluations.

However, most of these policies are trained on data collected from limited robot positions and camera viewpoints. This leads to poor generalization to novel robot positions, which limits the use of these policies on mobile platforms, especially for precise tasks like pressing buttons or turning faucets. In this work, we formulate the "policy mobilization" problem: find a mobile robot base pose in a novel environment that is in distribution with respect to a manipulation policy trained on a limited set of camera viewpoints. Compared to retraining the policy itself to be more robust to unseen robot base pose initializations, policy mobilization decouples navigation from manipulation and thus does not require additional demonstrations. With that, our formulation is still compatible with any approach that improves manipulation policy robustness. To study policy mobilization, we introduce the Mobi-$\pi$ framework, which includes: (1) metrics that quantify the difficulty of mobilizing a given policy, (2) a suite of simulated mobile manipulation tasks based on RoboCasa to evaluate policy mobilization, (3) visualization tools for analysis, and (4) several baseline methods. We also propose a novel approach that bridges navigation and manipulation by optimizing the robot's base pose to align with an in-distribution base pose for a learned policy. Our approach utilizes a 3D Gaussian Splatting model for novel viewpoint synthesis, a score function to evaluate pose suitability, as well as sampling-based optimization to identify optimal robot poses. We show that our approach on average outperforms the best baseline by 7.65$\times$ in simulation and 2.38$\times$ in the real world, demonstrating its effectiveness for policy mobilization.}

While prior work has explored visual augmentation in single-arm settings, extending these approaches to bimanual manipulation requires generating viewpoint-consistent observations across both arms and producing corresponding action labels that are both valid and feasible.

    To this end, we propose $\textit{UnPose}$, a novel framework for zero-shot, model-free 6D object pose estimation and reconstruction that exploits 3D priors and uncertainty estimates from a pre-trained diffusion model. 
    Specifically, starting from a single-view RGB-D frame, $\textit{UnPose}$ uses a multi-view diffusion model to estimate an initial 3D model using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, along with pixel-wise epistemic uncertainty estimates.
    As additional observations become available, we incrementally refine the 3DGS model by fusing new views guided by the diffusion model's uncertainty,
    thereby, continuously improving the pose estimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. 
    To ensure global consistency, the diffusion prior-generated views and subsequent observations are further integrated in a pose graph and jointly optimized into a coherent 3DGS field.
    Extensive experiments demonstrate that $\textit{UnPose}$ significantly outperforms existing approaches in both 6D pose estimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality.

	abstract = {Large-scale demonstration data has powered key breakthroughs in robot manipulation, but collecting that data remains costly and time-consuming. To this end, we present Constraint-Preserving Data Generation (CP-Gen), a method that uses a single expert trajectory to generate robot demonstrations containing novel object geometries and poses. These generated demonstrations are used to train closed-loop visuomotor policies that transfer zero-shot to the real world. Similar to prior data-generation work focused on pose variations, CP-Gen first decomposes expert demonstrations into free-space motions and robot skills. Unlike prior work, we achieve geometry-aware data generation by formulating robot skills as keypoint-trajectory constraints: keypoints on the robot or grasped object must track a reference trajectory defined relative to a task-relevant object. To generate a new demonstration, CP-Gen samples pose and geometry transforms for each task-relevant object, then applies these transforms to the object and its associated keypoints or keypoint trajectories. We optimize robot joint configurations so that the keypoints on the robot or grasped object track the transformed keypoint trajectory, and then motion plan a collision-free path to the first optimized joint configuration. Using demonstrations generated by CP-Gen, we train visuomotor policies that generalize across variations in object geometries and poses. Experiments on 16 simulation tasks and four real-world tasks, featuring multi-stage, non-prehensile and tight-tolerance manipulation, show that policies trained using our method achieve an average success rate of 77\%, outperforming the best baseline which achieves an average success rate of 50\%.}

Motivated by this principle, we introduce EyeRobot, a robotic system with gaze behavior that emerges from the need to complete real-world tasks. We develop a mechanical eyeball that can freely rotate to observe its surroundings and train a gaze policy to control it using reinforcement learning. We accomplish this by introducing a BC-RL loop trained using teleoperated demonstrations recorded with a 360 camera. The resulting video enables a simulation environment that supports rendering arbitrary eyeball viewpoints, allowing reinforcement learning of gaze behavior. The hand (BC) agent is trained from rendered eye observations, and the eye (RL) agent is rewarded when the hand produces correct actions. In this way, hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks towards regions which allow the hand to complete the task. We evaluate EyeRobot on five large workspace manipulation tasks and compare performance to two common camera setups: wrist and external cameras. Our experiments suggest EyeRobot exhibits hand-eye coordination which effectively facilitates action such as visual search or target switching, which enable manipulation across large workspaces.}

To address this limitation, we propose a differentiable contact model designed to provide informative gradients while maintaining high physical fidelity. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by training a quadrupedal locomotion policy within our differentiable simulator leveraging analytic gradients and successfully transferring the learned policy zero-shot to the real world. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first successful sim-to-real transfer of a legged locomotion policy learned entirely within a differentiable simulator, establishing the feasibility of using differentiable simulation for real-world locomotion control.}

Recent work has proposed learning-based approaches for the autonomous manipulation of soft tissue.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel second-order metric for uncertainty quantification, agreement volatility, that enables successful and efficient collaborative handoffs between a human operator and a robot during soft-tissue manipulation by allowing the robot to know when to cede control to human operators and when to resume autonomous operation. We validate our approach using the daVinci Research Kit (dVRK) surgical robot to perform risk-aware physical soft-tissue manipulation. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed agreement volatility metric improves system success rates and leads to a 10\% lower reliance on human interventions compared to a variance-only baseline.  We further demonstrate the usefulness of our agreement volatility metric as a spatial uncertainty map over geometric point cloud data, enabling uncertainty attribution which provides insight into regions of the input causing uncertainty.}

Recently, visual navigation models, particularly foundation models, have demonstrated promising performance by generating viable trajectories using only RGB images. However, these policies can generalize poorly to environments containing out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes characterized by unseen objects or different camera setups (e.g., variations in field of view, camera pose, or focal length). Without fine-tuning, such models could produce trajectories that lead to collisions, necessitating substantial efforts in data collection and additional training.
To address this limitation, we introduce CARE, an attachable module that enhances the safety of visual navigation without requiring additional range sensors or fine-tuning of pretrained models. CARE can be integrated seamlessly into any RGB-based navigation model that generates local robot trajectories. It dynamically adjusts trajectories produced by a pretrained model using repulsive force vectors computed from depth images estimated directly from RGB inputs. 
We evaluate CARE by integrating it with state-of-the-art visual navigation models across diverse robot platforms. Real-world experiments show that CARE significantly reduces collisions (up to 100%) without compromising navigation performance in goal-conditioned navigation, and further improves collision-free travel distance (up to 10.7$\times$) in exploration tasks.}

However, we humans use all body parts to interact with the world, e.g., we sit in chairs, get up from the ground, or roll on the floor. Contacting the environment using body parts other than feet and hands brings significant challenges in both model-predictive control and reinforcement learning-based methods: an unpredictable contact sequence makes it almost impossible for model-predictive control to plan ahead in real time; the success of sim-to-real reinforcement learning for humanoids heavily depends on the acceleration of the rigid-body physical simulator and the simplification of collision detection. On the other hand, lacking extreme torso movement of humanoid data makes all other components non-trivial to design, such as dataset distribution, motion commands, and task rewards. To address these challenges, we propose a general humanoid motion framework that takes discrete motion commands and controls the robot's motor actions in real time. Using a GPU-accelerated simulator, we train a humanoid whole-body control policy that follows the high-level motion command in the real world in real time, even with stochastic contacts and extremely large robot base rotation and not-so-feasible motion commands.}

A subsequent high-level, goal-conditioned policy then builds on these priors, learning residual corrections that enable perceptive locomotion, local obstacle avoidance, and goal-directed navigation across diverse and rugged terrains.
Simulation experiments illustrate the effectiveness of learned residuals in adapting to progressively challenging uneven terrains while still preserving the locomotion characteristics provided by the motion priors.
Furthermore, our results demonstrate improvements in motion regularization over baseline models trained without motion priors under similar reward setups.

To close this gap, we propose VLM-AD, a method that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) as teachers to enhance training by providing additional supervision that incorporates unstructured reasoning information and structured action labels. Such supervision enhances the model's ability to learn richer feature representations that capture the rationale behind driving patterns. Importantly, our method does not require a VLM during inference, making it practical for real-time deployment. When integrated with state-of-the-art methods, VLM-AD achieves significant improvements in planning accuracy and reduced collision rates on the nuScenes dataset.

the versatility and robustness of semantics in three critical ways to
derive a rigorous registration pipeline for multi-robot GSplat maps.
First, SIREN utilizes semantics to identify feature-rich regions
of the local maps where the registration problem is better posed,
eliminating the need for any initialization which is generally
required in prior work. Second, SIREN identifies candidate
correspondences between Gaussians in the local maps using
robust semantic features, constituting the foundation for robust
geometric optimization, coarsely aligning 3D Gaussian primitives
extracted from the local maps. Third, this key step enables
subsequent photometric refinement of the transformation between
the submaps, where SIREN leverages novel-view synthesis in
GSplat maps along with a semantics-based image filter to compute
a high-accuracy non-rigid transformation for the generation of a
high-fidelity fused map. We demonstrate the superior performance
of SIREN compared to competing baselines across a range of
real-world datasets, and in particular, across the most widely
used robot hardware platforms, including a manipulator, drone,

In fact, in the most challenging scenes

SIREN achieves about 90x

44x smaller scale errors, compared to
competing methods.

Inspired by this, we introduce ArtiPoint, a novel estimation framework capable of inferring articulated object models under dynamic camera motion and partial observability. By combining deep point tracking with a factor graph optimization framework, ArtiPoint robustly estimates articulated part trajectories and articulation axes directly from raw RGB-D videos. To foster future research in this domain, we introduce Arti4D, the first ego-centric in-the-wild dataset capturing articulated object interactions at a scene level, accompanied with articulation labels and ground truth camera poses.

Our method leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to train an outer-loop control policy for each MAV. Unlike state-of-the-art controllers that utilize a centralized scheme, our policy does not require global states, inter-MAV communications, nor neighboring MAV information. Instead, agents communicate implicitly through load pose observations alone, which enables high scalability and flexibility. It also significantly reduces computing costs during inference time, enabling onboard deployment of the policy. In addition, we introduce a new action space design for the MAVs using linear acceleration and body rates. This choice, combined with a robust low-level controller, enables reliable sim-to-real transfer despite significant uncertainties caused by cable tension during dynamic 3D motion. We validate our method in various real-world experiments, including full-pose control under load model uncertainties, showing setpoint tracking performance comparable to the state-of-the-art centralized method. We also demonstrate cooperation amongst agents with heterogeneous control policies, and robustness to the complete in-flight loss of one MAV.

As a result, we find that Oat-VLA can drastically reduce the number of visual tokens  to just a few tokens without sacrificing performance. We reveal that Oat-VLA converges at least twice as fast as OpenVLA on the LIBERO suite, as well as outperform OpenVLA in diverse real-world pick and place tasks.}

However, current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models lack the ability to integrate such subtle physical feedback. In this work, we explore Torque-aware VLA models, aiming to bridge this gap by systematically studying the design space for incorporating torque signals into existing VLA architectures. We identify and evaluate several strategies, leading to three key findings. First, introducing torque adapters into the decoder consistently outperforms inserting them into the encoder.  This is because torque signals align more closely with the decoder's input, and the decoder is more sensitive to variations in input. Second, torque history proves to be a critical signal. We find that the most effective way to incorporate it is by summarizing the entire history into a single token, as this preserves the original input pattern of the decoder. Third, inspired by joint prediction and planning paradigms in autonomous driving, we propose predicting torque as an auxiliary output, which further improves performance. This strategy encourages the model to build a physically grounded internal representation of interaction dynamics. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments across contact-rich manipulation benchmarks validate our findings. Code, models, and datasets will be released.}

Our key insight is that by leveraging a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to identify approximate placement locations, we can focus only on the relevant regions for precise local placement, which enables us to train the low-level placement-pose-prediction model to capture multimodal placements efficiently. For training, we generate a fully synthetic dataset comprising 13 categories of randomly generated objects in 5370 different placement poses across three configurations (insertion, stacking, hanging) and train local placement-prediction models. We extensively evaluate our method in high-fidelity simulation and show that it consistently outperforms baseline approaches across all three tasks in terms of success rate, coverage of placement modes, and precision. In real-world experiments, our method achieves an average success and coverage rate of 76\% across three tasks, where most baseline methods fail completely. We further validate the generalization of our approach on 16 real-world placement tasks, demonstrating that models trained purely on synthetic data can be directly transferred to the real world in a zero-shot setting.

R1-Zero approach was originally developed to enable mathematical reasoning in

allows reasoning in Embodied Artificial Intelligence (EmbodiedAI) settings without relying solely on distillation of large models through Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT). We show that small-scale LLMs can achieve effective reasoning performance by learning through closed-loop interaction with their environment, which
enables tasks that previously required significantly larger models. A performance
gain of 20.2% points over the SFT-based baseline is observed with a Qwen2.5-1.5B
model. Using the proposed training procedure, Qwen2.5-3B achieves a 63.3%
control adaptability score, surpassing the 58.5% obtained by the much larger,

While prior works primarily focus on teleoperation or video-based retargeting, they often suffer from kinematic mismatches and the absence of real-time tactile feedback, hindering the acquisition of high-fidelity tactile data. To mitigate this issue, we propose KineDex, a hand-over-hand kinesthetic teaching paradigm in which the operator's motion is directly transferred to the dexterous hand, enabling the collection of physically grounded demonstrations enriched with accurate tactile feedback. To resolve occlusions from human hand, we apply inpainting technique to preprocess the visual observations. Based on these demonstrations, we then train a visuomotor policy using tactile-augmented inputs and implement force control during deployment for precise contact-rich manipulation. We evaluate KineDex on a suite of challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks, including particularly difficult scenarios such as squeezing toothpaste onto a toothbrush, which require precise multi-finger coordination and stable force regulation. Across these tasks, KineDex achieves an average success rate of 74.4\%, representing a 57.7\% improvement over the variant without force control. Comparative experiments with teleoperation and user studies further validate the advantages of KineDex in data collection efficiency and operability. Specifically, KineDex collects data over twice as fast as teleoperation across two tasks of varying difficulty, while maintaining a near-100\% success rate, compared to under 50\% for teleoperation.}

However, in practical applications, hardware limitations often degrade data quality, while real-time constraints restrict model inference to instantaneous state and scene observations. These limitations seriously reduce the efficacy of learning from expert demonstrations, resulting in failures in object localization, grasp planning, and long-horizon task execution.
To address these challenges, we propose Causal Diffusion Policy (CDP), a novel transformer-based diffusion model that enhances action prediction by conditioning on historical action sequences, thereby enabling more coherent and context-aware visuomotor policy learning.
In practice, to further mitigate the computational cost associated with autoregressive inference, a caching mechanism is also introduced to store attention key-value pairs from previous timesteps, substantially reducing redundant computations during execution.
Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments, spanning diverse 2D and 3D manipulation tasks, demonstrate that CDP uniquely leverages historical action sequences to achieve significantly higher accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, even when faced with degraded observation quality, CDP maintains remarkable precision by reasoning through temporal continuity, which highlights its practical robustness for robotic control under realistic, imperfect conditions.}

The system helps regulate the agent's actions and enables it to adapt to distribution shifts. In the in-distribution setting, our approach achieves a 96.93\% success rate, which is over 8.80\% higher than the previous state-of-the-art baselines with over 3.72 times fewer collisions and 2.43 times fewer intrusions into ground-truth human future trajectories. In three out-of-distribution scenarios, our method shows much stronger robustness when facing distribution shifts in velocity variations, policy changes, and transitions from individual to group dynamics. We deploy our method on a real robot, and experiments show that the robot makes safe and robust decisions when interacting with both sparse and dense crowds.}

The challenge lies in the combinatorial nature of instruction specifications: each instruction can include multiple specifications, and the number of possible specification combinations grows exponentially as the robot's skill set expands. For example, ``overtake the pedestrian while staying on the right side of the road'' consists of two specifications: *"overtake the pedestrian"* and *"walk on the right side of the road."*
To tackle this challenge, we propose ComposableNav, based on the intuition that following an instruction involves independently satisfying its constituent specifications, each corresponding to a distinct motion primitive. 
Using diffusion models, ComposableNav learns each primitive separately, then composes them in parallel at deployment time to satisfy novel combinations of specifications unseen in training. 
Additionally, to avoid the onerous need for demonstrations of individual motion primitives, we propose a two-stage training procedure: (1) supervised pre-training to learn a base diffusion model for dynamic navigation, and (2) reinforcement learning fine-tuning that molds the base model into different motion primitives.
Through simulation and real-world experiments, we show that ComposableNav enables robots to follow instructions by generating trajectories that satisfy diverse and unseen combinations of specifications, significantly outperforming both non-compositional VLM-based policies and costmap composing baselines.}

To address this, we introduce Joint Model-based Model-free Diffusion (JM2D), a novel generative modeling framework. JM2D formulates module integration as a joint sampling problem to maximize compatibility via an interaction potential, without additional training. Using importance sampling, JM2D guides modules outputs based only on evaluations of the interaction potential, thus handling non-differentiable objectives commonly arising from non-convex optimization modules. We evaluate JM2D via application to aligning diffusion planners with safety modules on offline RL and robot manipulation. JM2D significantly improves task performance compared to conventional safety filters without sacrificing safety. Further, we show that conditional generation is a special case of JM2D and elucidate key design choices by comparing with SOTA gradient-based and projection-based diffusion planners.

However, generalizing to new settings---such as unseen scenes, tasks, and object instances---remains a significant challenge. Although large-scale robot demonstration datasets have shown potential for inducing generalization, they are resource-intensive to scale. In contrast, human video data is abundant and diverse, presenting an attractive alternative. Yet, these human-video datasets lack action labels, complicating their use in imitation learning. Existing methods attempt to extract grounded action representations (e.g., hand poses), but resulting policies struggle to bridge the embodiment gap between human and robot actions. We propose an alternative approach: leveraging language-based reasoning from human videos---essential for guiding robot actions---to train generalizable robot policies. Building on recent advances in reasoning-based policy architectures, we introduce Reasoning through Action-free Data (RAD). RAD learns from both robot demonstration data (with reasoning and action labels) and action-free human video data (with only reasoning labels). The robot data teaches the model to map reasoning to low-level actions, while the action-free data enhances reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we release a new dataset of 3,377 human-hand demonstrations compatible with the Bridge V2 benchmark. This dataset includes chain-of-thought reasoning annotations and hand-tracking data, and is aimed at facilitating future research on reasoning-driven robot learning. Our experiments demonstrate that RAD enables effective transfer across the embodiment gap, allowing robots to perform tasks seen only in action-free data. Furthermore, scaling up action-free reasoning data significantly improves policy performance and generalization to novel tasks.

In this paper, we propose a novel three-stage framework for in-hand pose estimation. The first stage involves sampling and pre-ranking pose candidates, followed by iterative refinement of these candidates in the second stage. In the final stage, post-ranking is applied to identify the most likely pose candidates. These stages are governed by a unified energy-based diffusion model, which is trained solely on simulated data. This energy model simultaneously generates gradients to refine pose estimates and produces an energy scalar that quantifies the quality of the pose estimates. Additionally, inspired by the computer vision domain, we incorporate a render-compare architecture within the energy-based score network to significantly enhance sim-to-real performance, as demonstrated by our ablation studies. Extensive experimental evaluations show that our method outperforms conventional baselines based on regression, matching, and registration techniques, while also exhibiting strong generalization to previously unseen CAD models.

In this work, we introduce a sampling-free approach for estimating well-calibrated confidence values by explicitly modeling aleatoric uncertainty in semantic segmentation, achieving alignment with true classification accuracy and reducing inference time compared to sampling-based methods. Evaluated on the real-world SemanticKITTI benchmark, our approach achieves 1.70\% and 1.33\% Adaptive Calibration Error (ACE) in semantic segmentation of LiDAR data using RangeViT and SalsaNext models, and is more than one order of magnitude faster than the comparable baseline.

To address this, we introduce an uncertainty-aware latent safety filter that proactively steers robots away from both known and unseen failures.

We propose a principled method to detect OOD world model predictions by calibrating an uncertainty threshold via conformal prediction. By performing reachability analysis in an augmented state space---spanning both the latent representation and the epistemic uncertainty---we synthesize a latent safety filter that can reliably safeguard arbitrary policies from both known and unseen safety hazards. In simulation and hardware experiments on vision-based control tasks with a Franka manipulator, we show that our uncertainty-aware safety filter preemptively detects potential unsafe scenarios and reliably proposes safe, in-distribution actions.}

While humans can mimic tool manipulation behavior by observing others perform a task just once and effortlessly transfer the skill to diverse tools for functionally equivalent tasks, current robots struggle to achieve this level of generalization. A key challenge lies in establishing function-level correspondences, considering the significant geometric variations among functionally similar tools, referred to as intra-function variations. To address this challenge, we propose MimicFunc, a framework that establishes functional correspondences with function frame, a function-centric local coordinate frame constructed with 3D functional keypoints, for imitating tool manipulation skills. Experiments demonstrate that MimicFunc effectively enables the robot to generalize the skill from a single RGB-D human video to manipulating novel tools for functionally equivalent tasks. Furthermore, leveraging MimicFunc's one-shot generalization capability, the generated rollouts can be used to train visuomotor policies without requiring labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for novel objects.}

Current methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) restricted controllability due to decoupled upper- and lower-body control, and (2) severe drift caused by open-loop execution. These issues prevent humanoid robots from performing coordinated whole-body motions required for long-horizon loco-manipulation tasks. We introduce CLONE, a whole-body teleoperation system that overcomes these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) whole-body control policy that enables complex coordinated movements, such as ``picking up an object from the ground'' and ``placing it in a distant bin''; (2) a closed-loop error correction mechanism using LiDAR odometry, reducing translational drift to 12cm over 8.9-meter trajectories; and (3) a systematic data augmentation strategy that ensures robust performance under diverse, previously unseen operator poses. In extensive experiments, CLONE demonstrates robust performance across diverse scenarios while maintaining stable whole-body control. These capabilities significantly advance humanoid robotics by enabling the collection of long-horizon interaction data and establishing a foundation for more sophisticated humanoid-environment interaction in both research and practical applications.}

While humanoids are increasingly featured in flashy demos---dancing, delivering packages, traversing rough terrain---fine-grained control during locomotion remains a significant challenge. In particular, stabilizing a filled end-effector (EE) while walking is far from solved, due to a fundamental mismatch in task dynamics: locomotion demands slow-timescale, robust control, whereas EE stabilization requires rapid, high-precision corrections. To address this, we propose SoFTA, a Slow-Fast Two-Agent framework that decouples upper-body and lower-body control into separate agents operating at different frequencies and with distinct rewards. This temporal and objective separation mitigates policy interference mitagates objective conflict and enables coordinated whole-body behavior. SoFTA executes upper-body actions at 100 Hz for precise EE control and lower-body actions at 50 Hz for robust gait. It reduces EE acceleration by 2-5x to baselines and performs 2--3x closer to human-level stability, enabling delicate tasks such as carrying nearly full cups, capturing steady video during locomotion, and disturbance rejection with EE stability.}

We present HyperTASR, a hypernetwork-driven framework that modulates scene representations based on both task objectives and the execution phase. Our architecture dynamically generates representation transformation parameters conditioned on task specifications and progression state, enabling representations to evolve contextually throughout task execution. This approach maintains architectural compatibility with existing policy learning frameworks while fundamentally reconfiguring how visual features are processed. Unlike methods that simply concatenate or fuse task embeddings with task-agnostic representations, HyperTASR establishes computational separation between task-contextual and state-dependent processing paths, enhancing learning efficiency and representational quality. Comprehensive evaluations in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate substantial performance improvements across different representation paradigms. Most notably, HyperTASR elevates success rates by over 27\% when applied to GNFactor and achieves unprecedented single-view performance exceeding 80\% success with 3D Diffuser Actor. Through ablation studies and attention visualization, we confirm that our approach selectively prioritizes task-relevant scene information, closely mirroring human adaptive perception during manipulation tasks.}

We conducted 375 trials, systematically varying obstacle spacing, robot orientation, and leg actions in 75 of them. Results show that movement of closely-spaced obstacles exhibit significant interference, requiring joint modeling. In addition, different multi-leg excavation actions could cause distinct robot state changes, necessitating integrated planning of manipulation and locomotion. To address these challenges, DiffusiveGRAIN includes a diffusion-based environment predictor to capture multi-obstacle movements under granular flow interferences and a robot state predictor to estimate changes in robot state from multi-leg action patterns. Deployment experiments (90 trials) demonstrate that by integrating the environment and robot state predictors, the robot can autonomously plan its movements based on loco-manipulation goals, successfully shifting closely located rocks to desired locations in over 65\% of trials. Our study showcases the potential for a locomoting robot to strategically manipulate obstacles to achieve improved mobility on challenging terrains.}

To address these limitations, we propose Articulate AnyMesh, an automated framework that is able to convert any rigid 3D mesh into its articulated counterpart in an open-vocabulary manner. Given a 3D mesh, our framework utilizes advanced Vision-Language Models and visual prompting techniques to extract semantic information, allowing for both the segmentation of object parts and the construction of functional joints. Our experiments show that Articulate AnyMesh can generate large-scale, high-quality 3D articulated objects, including tools, toys, mechanical devices, and vehicles, significantly expanding the coverage of existing 3D articulated object datasets. Additionally, we show that these generated assets can facilitate the acquisition of new articulated object manipulation skills in simulation, which can then be transferred to a real robotic system.}

	abstract = {In this work, we study the problem of data retrieval for few-shot imitation learning: select data from a large dataset to train a performant policy for a specific task, given only a few target demonstrations. Prior methods retrieve data using a single-feature distance heuristic, assuming that the best demonstrations are those that most closely resemble the target examples in visual, semantic, or motion space. However, this approach captures only a subset of the relevant information and is prone to introducing detrimental demonstrations, e.g., retrieving data from unrelated tasks due to similar scene layouts, or selecting similar motions from tasks with divergent goals. We present COLLAGE, a method for COLLective data AGgrEgation in few-shot imitation learning that uses an adaptive late fusion mechanism to guide the selection of relevant demonstrations based on a task12 specific combination of multiple cues. COLLAGE follows a simple, but flexible and efficient data aggregation recipe: it assigns weights to subsets of the dataset that are pre-selected using a single feature (e.g., appearance, shape, or language similarity), based on their task relevance, measured by how well a policy trained on each subset predicts actions in the few target demonstrations. These weights are then used during policy training to perform importance sampling over the aggregated dataset, sampling data more densely or sparsely, according to their estimated relevance. This weighted aggregation strategy is general and feature-agnostic, allowing COLLAGE to combine and leverage any number of subsets selected by any retrieval heuristic or method, and to identify which subset provides the most benefit for the target task. In extensive experiments, COLLAGE outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval and multi-task learning approaches, achieving a 5.1\% improvement over the best baseline in simulation across 10 tasks, and a 16.6\% improvement in the real world across 6 tasks. For our real world experiments, we include data selection from the large-scale, real-world DROID dataset, significantly improving few-shot imitation policy training.

In this paper, we propose a motion generation model that can adjust actions in response to qualitative human instructions during task execution. The core of the proposed method is a learning architecture that maps qualitative human instructions to actions. Specifically, the demonstration is divided into short action sequences, and labels reflecting human qualitative senses are assigned to these sequences to realize learning that links human qualitative instructions and robot actions. In evaluation experiments, we verified the effectiveness of the method in two tasks: a pick-and-place task and a wiping task. Experimental results showed that the proposed method is able to generate motions in response to human qualitative instructions during task execution, whereas the conventional method generates trajectories all at once, making it impossible to adjust motions during task execution.}

However, despite promising early attempts, a systematic understanding of which LLM modules are truly transferable remains lacking. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of five key LLM modules---tokenizer design, positional embedding, pre-training paradigms, post-training strategies, and test-time computation---within the context of motion generation for autonomous driving. Through extensive experiments on the Waymo Sim Agents benchmark, we demonstrate that, when appropriately adapted, these modules can significantly improve performance for autonomous driving motion generation. In addition, we identify which techniques can be effectively transferred, analyze the potential reasons for the failure of others, and discuss the specific adaptations needed for autonomous driving scenarios.

Recognizing that collisions are primarily pairwise, we train two conditional diffusion models, one to generate feasible single-arm trajectories, and a second, to model the dual-arm dynamics required for effective pairwise collision resolution. By integrating these specialized generative models within a MAPF-inspired structured decomposition, our planner efficiently scales to larger number of arms. Evaluations against alternative learning-based methods across various team sizes demonstrate our method's effectiveness and practical applicability. Code and data will be made publicly available.

SPF harness VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative annotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted traveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement vectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the traveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF performs navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow dynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL simulation benchmark, out performing the previous best method by an absolute margin of 63\%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong baselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to highlight the effectiveness of our design choice.

Real-world evaluation is often challenging due to safety concerns and a lack of reproducibility, whereas closed-loop simulation can face insufficient realism or high computational costs. Open-loop evaluation, while being efficient and data-driven, relies on metrics that generally overlook compounding errors. In this paper, we propose pseudo-simulation, a novel paradigm that addresses these limitations. Pseudo-simulation operates on real datasets, similar to open-loop evaluation, but augments them with synthetic observations generated prior to evaluation using 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to approximate potential future states the AV might encounter by generating a diverse set of observations that vary in position, heading, and speed. Our method then assigns a higher importance to synthetic observations that best match the AV's likely behavior using a novel proximity-based weighting scheme. This enables evaluating error recovery and the mitigation of causal confusion, as in closed-loop benchmarks, without requiring sequential interactive simulation. We show that pseudo-simulation is better correlated with closed-loop simulations ($R^2=0.8$) than the best existing open-loop approach ($R^2=0.7$). We also establish a public leaderboard for the community to benchmark new methodologies with pseudo-simulation.}

First, a set of highly dynamic low-level skills is trained for legged locomotion and ball manipulation, such as walking, dribbling, and kicking. On top of these, a high-level strategic planning policy is trained with Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) via Fictitious Self-Play (FSP). This learning framework allows agents to adapt to diverse opponent strategies and gives rise to sophisticated team behaviors, including coordinated passing, interception, and dynamic role allocation. With an extensive ablation study, the proposed learning method shows significant advantages in the cooperative and competitive multi-agent soccer game.

To address this, we introduce Contrastive Learning via Action Sequence Supervision (CLASS), a method for learning behavioral representations from demonstrations using supervised contrastive learning. CLASS leverages weak supervision from similar action sequences identified via Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and optimizes a soft InfoNCE loss with similarity-weighted positive pairs. We evaluate CLASS on 5 simulation benchmarks and 3 real-world tasks to achieve competitive results using retrieval-based control with representations only. Most notably, for downstream policy learning under significant visual shifts, CLASS achieves an average success rate of 70\% with Diffusion Policy, while all other baseline methods fail to perform competitively.}

However, their outputs lack grounding, making it difficult to determine whether imagined transitions are physically feasible or informative. To bridge the gap between imagination and execution, we present IVE (Imagine, Verify, Execute), an agentic exploration framework inspired by human curiosity.  Human exploration often emerges from the drive to discover novel scene configurations and to understand the environment.
Inspired by this, IVE leverages VLMs to abstract RGB-D observations into semantic scene graphs, imagine novel scenes, predict their physical plausibility, and generate executable skill sequences through action tools. We evaluate IVE in both simulated and real-world tabletop environments. The results show that IVE produces more diverse and meaningful exploration than RL baselines. The collected data facilitates learning downstream tasks that closely match those of policies trained on human-collected demonstrations.}

To address this gap between assumed and actual capability, we propose a novel trajectory generation approach using denoising diffusion models that explicitly incorporates payload constraints into the planning process. Unlike traditional sampling-based methods that rely on inefficient trial-and-error, optimization-based methods that are prohibitively slow, or kinodynamic planners that struggle with problem dimensionality, our approach generates dynamically feasible joint-space trajectories in constant time that can be directly executed on physical hardware without post-processing. Experimental validation on a 7 DoF Franka Emika Panda robot demonstrates that up to 67.6\% of the workspace remains accessible even with payloads exceeding 3 times the nominal capacity. This expanded operational envelope highlights the importance of a more nuanced consideration of payload dynamics in motion planning algorithms.}

Existing approaches primarily rely on extensive data collection and imitation learning, which are expensive, labor-intensive, and difficult to scale. Sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative, but has mostly succeeded in simpler state-based or single-hand setups. How to effectively extend this to vision-based, contact-rich bimanual manipulation tasks remains an open question. In this paper, we introduce a practical sim-to-real RL recipe that trains a humanoid robot to perform three challenging dexterous manipulation tasks: grasp-and-reach, box lift and bimanual handover. Our method features an automated real-to-sim tuning module, a generalized reward formulation based on contact and object goals, a divide-and-conquer policy distillation framework, and a hybrid object representation strategy with modality-specific augmentation. We demonstrate high success rates on unseen objects and robust, adaptive policy behaviors -- highlighting that vision-based dexterous manipulation via sim-to-real RL is not only viable, but also scalable and broadly applicable to real-world humanoid manipulation tasks.}

In this work, we present ParticleFormer, a Transformer-based point cloud world model trained with a hybrid point cloud reconstruction loss, supervising both global and local dynamics features in multi-material, multi-object robot interactions. ParticleFormer captures fine-grained multi-object interactions between rigid, deformable, and flexible materials, trained directly from real-world robot perception data without an elaborate scene reconstruction. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness both in 3D scene forecasting tasks, and in downstream manipulation tasks using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) policy.  In addition, we extend existing dynamics learning benchmarks to include diverse multi-material, multi-object interaction scenarios. We validate our method on six simulation and three real-world experiments, where it consistently outperforms leading baselines by achieving superior dynamics prediction accuracy and less rollout error in downstream visuomotor tasks.

However, conventional model-based pipelines are fragile---each component (e.g., detection, motion planning) requires manual tuning and struggles to incorporate high-level endoscopic intent, resulting in poor generalization across variable scenes. Vision--Language--Action (VLA) models, which integrate visual perception, language grounding, and motion planning within an end-to-end framework, offer a promising alternative to semantically adapt to surgeon prompts, without the need for manual recalibration. Despite their potential, applying VLA models to robotic endoscopy presents unique challenges due to the inherently complex and dynamic anatomical environments of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. To this end, we introduce EndoVLA, designed specifically for continuum robots in GI interventions. Provided endoscopic images and surgeon-issued tracking prompts, EndoVLA performs three core tasks: (1) polyp tracking, (2) delineation and following of abnormal mucosal regions, and (3) adherence to predefined circular markers during circumferential cutting. To address the unique challenges posed by data scarcity and domain shifts, we propose a dual-phase strategy, with supervised fine-tuning on our EndoVLA-Motion dataset and reinforcement fine-tuning using task-aware rewards. Our approach significantly enhances the tracking performance in endoscopy, and zero-shot generalization of tracking in general scenes and more challenging sequential tasks.}

Previous dexterous teleoperation mostly relies on hand retargeting to closely mimic human hand postures. However, these approaches may fail to fully leverage the inherent dexterity of dexterous hands, which can execute unique actions through their structural advantages compared to human hands. To address this limitation, we propose TypeTele, a type-guided dexterous teleoperation system, which enables dexterous hands to perform actions that are not constrained by human motion patterns. This is achieved by introducing dexterous manipulation types into the teleoperation system, allowing operators to employ appropriate types to complete specific tasks. To support this system, we build an extensible dexterous manipulation type library to cover comprehensive dexterous postures used in manipulation tasks. During teleoperation, we employ a MLLM (Multi-modality Large Language Model)-assisted type retrieval module to identify the most suitable manipulation type based on the specific task and operator commands. Extensive experiments of real-world teleoperation and imitation learning demonstrate that the incorporation of manipulation types significantly takes full advantage of the dexterous robot's ability to perform diverse and complex tasks with higher success rates.}

However, for such models to be truly useful, an end user must have easy means to teach them to improve. For language and vision models, the emergent ability to perform in-context learning (ICL) has proven to be a versatile and highly useful interface to easily teach new tasks with no parameter finetuning. Unfortunately, VLAs pre-trained with imitation learning objectives do not naturally acquire ICL abilities. In this paper, we demonstrate that, with the right finetuning recipe and a small robot demonstration dataset, it is possible to inject in-context adaptability post hoc into such a VLA. After retraining for in-context learning (RICL), our system permits an end user to provide a small number (10-20) of demonstrations for a new task. RICL then fetches the most relevant portions of those demonstrations into the VLA context to exploit ICL, performing the new task and boosting task performance. We apply RICL to inject ICL into the $\pi_0$-FAST VLA, and show that it permits large in-context improvements for a variety of new manipulation tasks with only 20 demonstrations per task, without any parameter updates. When parameter updates on the target task demonstrations is possible, RICL finetuning further boosts performance. We release code and model weights for RICL-$\pi_0$-FAST alongside the paper to enable, for the first time, a simple in-context learning interface for new manipulation tasks}

However, current trajectory optimisation methods often struggle in these settings due to the large search space and the sparse task information available from shape-matching cost functions, particularly when contact is absent. In this work, we propose D-Cubed, a novel trajectory optimisation method using a latent diffusion model (LDM) trained from a task-agnostic play dataset to solve dexterous deformable object manipulation tasks. D-Cubed learns a skill-latent space that encodes short-horizon actions from a play dataset using a VAE and trains a LDM to compose the skill latents into a skill trajectory, representing a long-horizon action trajectory. To optimise a trajectory for a target task, we introduce a novel gradient-free guided sampling method that employs the Cross-Entropy method within the reverse diffusion process. In particular, D-Cubed samples a small number of noisy skill trajectories using the LDM for exploration and evaluates the trajectories in simulation. Then D-Cubed selects the trajectory with the lowest cost for the subsequent reverse process. This effectively explores promising solution areas and optimises the sampled trajectories towards a target task throughout the reverse diffusion process. Through empirical evaluation on a published benchmark of dexterous deformable object manipulation tasks, we demonstrate that D-Cubed outperforms traditional trajectory optimisation and competitive baseline approaches by a significant margin.}

Classical motion planners can compute globally optimal trajectories but require full environment knowledge and are typically too slow for dynamic scenes.

We propose Deep Reactive Policy (DRP), a visuo-motor neural motion policy designed for reactive motion generation in diverse dynamic environments, operating directly on point cloud sensory input. At its core is IMPACT, a transformer-based neural motion policy pretrained on 10 million generated expert trajectories across diverse simulation scenarios. We further improve IMPACT's static obstacle avoidance through iterative student-teacher finetuning. We additionally enhance the policy's dynamic obstacle avoidance at inference time using DCP-RMP, a locally reactive goal-proposal module.

We evaluate DRP on challenging tasks featuring cluttered scenes, dynamic moving obstacles, and goal obstructions. DRP achieves strong generalization, outperforming prior classical and neural methods in success rate across both simulated and real-world settings. We will release the dataset, simulation environments, and trained models upon acceptance. Refer to supplementary material for videos.}

This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied Question Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past experiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex, temporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically focus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a single past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past, present, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult its memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer. Standard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to limited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to combine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a structured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from cognitive science. Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based world instances, forming a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables targeted memory retrieval and guided navigation. To balance the exploration-recall trade-off, we introduce value-of-information-based stopping criteria that determines when the agent has gathered sufficient information. We evaluate our method on real-world experiments and introduce a new benchmark that spans popular simulation environments and actual industrial sites. Our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding substantial gains in both answer accuracy and exploration efficiency.}

This lack of explicit controllability limits existing methods to replaying recorded motions only, which hinders a wider application. To address this, we propose Motion Blender Gaussian Splatting (MB-GS), a novel framework that uses motion graph as an explicit and sparse motion representation. The motion of graph links is propagated to individual Gaussians via dual quaternion skinning, with learnable weight painting functions determining the influence of each link. The motion graphs and 3D Gaussians are jointly optimized from input videos via differentiable rendering. Experiments show that MB-GS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the iPhone dataset while being competitive on HyperNeRF. Additionally, we demonstrate the application potential of our method in animating novel object motions, synthesizing robot demonstrations through motion editing, and predicting robot actions through visual planning.}

The inferred frame is semantically grounded via a vision-language model and localized in novel scenes by Grounded-SAM, enabling functionally consistent skill generalization.

Our proposed approach unlocks behavior and environment generalization, allowing a humanoid robot to perform 20+ new behaviors in unseen environments while only collecting teleoperation data for pick and place in a single environment.

Model-based RL (MBRL) can approximate these gradients via learned dynamics models, but the solver efficiency suffers from compounding prediction errors during training rollouts, which can degrade policy performance. We propose an approach that decouples trajectory generation from gradient computation: trajectories are unrolled using a simulator, while gradients are computed via backpropagation through a learned differentiable model of the simulator. This hybrid design enables efficient and consistent first-order policy optimization, even when simulator gradients are unavailable, as well as learning a critic from simulation rollouts, which is more accurate. Our method achieves the sample efficiency and speed of specialized optimizers such as SHAC, while maintaining the generality of standard approaches like PPO and avoiding ill behaviors observed in other first-order MBRL methods. We empirically validate our algorithm on benchmark control tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real Go2 quadruped robot, across both quadrupedal and bipedal locomotion tasks.}

From inverse dynamics to quadratic programming based controllers, the effectiveness of these methods relies on accurate dynamics models of the robot and the object it manipulates. Any model mismatch results in task failures and unsafe behaviors. Thus, we introduce Rapid Mismatch Estimation (RME), an adaptive, controller-agnostic, probabilistic framework that estimates end-effector dynamics mismatches online, without relying on external force-torque sensors. From the robot's proprioceptive feedback, a Neural Network Model Mismatch Estimator generates a prior for a Variational Inference solver, which rapidly converges to the unknown parameters while quantifying uncertainty. With a real 7-DoF manipulator driven by a state-of-the-art passive impedance controller, RME adapts to sudden changes in mass and center of mass at the end-effector in $\sim400$ ms, in static and dynamic settings. We demonstrate RME in a collaborative scenario where a human attaches an unknown basket to the robot's end-effector and dynamically adds/removes heavy items, showcasing fast and safe adaptation to changing dynamics during physical interaction without any external sensory system.}

To address this, we propose Hierarchical Co-Self-Play (HCSP), a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that separates centralized high-level strategic decision-making from decentralized low-level motion control. We design a three-stage population-based training pipeline to enable both strategy and skill to emerge from scratch without expert demonstrations: (I) training diverse low-level skills, (II) learning high-level strategy via self-play with fixed low-level controllers, and (III) joint fine-tuning through co-self-play. Experiments show that HCSP achieves superior performance, outperforming non-hierarchical self-play and rule-based hierarchical baselines with an average 82.9\% win rate and a 71.5\% win rate against the two-stage variant. Moreover, co-self-play leads to emergent team behaviors such as role switching and coordinated formations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our hierarchical design and training scheme.}

RL, on the other hand, is scalable and does not suffer from compounding errors like imitation learning.
Contemporary RL approaches for driving use complex shaped rewards that sum multiple individual rewards, \eg~progress, position, or orientation rewards. 
We show that PPO fails to optimize a popular version of these rewards when the mini-batch size is increased, which limits the scalability of these approaches.
Instead, we propose a new reward design based primarily on optimizing a single intuitive reward term: route completion. 
Infractions are penalized by terminating the episode or multiplicatively reducing route completion.
We find that PPO scales well with higher mini-batch sizes when trained with our simple reward, even improving performance.
Training with large mini-batch sizes enables efficient scaling via distributed data parallelism. 
We scale PPO to 300M samples in CARLA and 500M samples in nuPlan with a single 8-GPU node.
The resulting model achieves 64 DS on the CARLA longest6 v2 benchmark, outperforming other RL methods with more complex rewards by a large margin.
Requiring only minimal adaptations from its use in CARLA, the same method is the best learning-based approach on nuPlan.
It scores 91.3 in non-reactive and 90.6 in reactive traffic on the Val14 benchmark while being an order of magnitude faster than prior work.}

We propose the first known method enabling robots to autonomously invent relational concepts directly from small sets of unannotated, unsegmented demonstrations. The learned symbolic concepts are grounded into logic-based world models, facilitating efficient zero-shot generalization to significantly more complex tasks. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to hand-crafted models, successfully scaling execution horizons and handling up to 18 times more objects than seen in training, providing the first autonomous framework for learning transferable symbolic abstractions from raw robot trajectories.}

	abstract = {End-to-end visuomotor policies trained using behavior cloning have shown a remarkable ability to generate complex, multi-modal low-level robot behaviors. However, at deployment time, these policies still struggle to act reliably when faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) visuals induced by objects, backgrounds, or environment changes. Prior works in interactive imitation learning solicit corrective expert demonstrations under the OOD conditions---but this can be costly and inefficient. We observe that task success under OOD conditions does not always warrant novel robot behaviors. In-distribution (ID) behaviors can directly be transferred to OOD conditions that share functional similarities with ID conditions. For example, behaviors trained to interact with in-distribution (ID) pens can apply to interacting with a visually-OOD pencil. The key challenge lies in disambiguating which ID observations functionally correspond to the OOD observation for the task at hand. We propose that an expert can provide this OOD-to-ID functional correspondence. Thus, instead of collecting new demonstrations and re-training at every OOD encounter, our method: (1) detects the need for feedback by checking if current observations are OOD and the most similar training observations show divergent behaviors (2) solicits functional correspondence feedback to disambiguate between those behaviors, and (3) intervenes on the OOD observations with the functionally corresponding ID observations to perform deployment-time generalization. We validate our method across diverse real-world robotic manipulation tasks with a Franka Panda robotic manipulator. Our results show that test-time functional correspondences can improve the generalization of a vision-based diffusion policy to OOD objects and environment conditions with low feedback.}

ViA learns task-relevant active perceptual strategies (e.g., searching, tracking, and focusing) directly from human demonstrations. On the hardware side, ViA employs a simple yet effective 6-DoF robotic neck to enable flexible, human-like head movements. To capture human active perception strategies, we design a VR-based teleoperation interface that creates a shared observation space between the robot and the human operator. To mitigate VR motion sickness caused by latency in the robot's physical movements, the interface uses an intermediate 3D scene representation, enabling real-time view rendering on the operator side while asynchronously updating the scene with the robot's latest observations. Together, these design elements enable the learning of robust visuomotor policies for three complex, multi-stage bimanual manipulation tasks involving visual occlusions, significantly outperforming baseline systems.}

	abstract = {Imitation learning has unlocked the potential for robots to exhibit highly dexterous behaviours. However, it still struggles with long-horizon, multi-object tasks due to poor sample efficiency and limited generalisation. Existing methods require a substantial number of demonstrations to cover possible task variations, making them costly and often impractical for real-world deployment. 
We address this challenge by introducing \emph{oriented affordance frames}, a structured representation for state and action spaces that improves spatial and intra-category generalisation and enables policies to be learned efficiently from only 10 demonstrations. More importantly, we show how this abstraction allows for compositional generalisation of independently trained sub-policies to solve long-horizon, multi-object tasks. To seamlessly transition between sub-policies, we introduce the notion of self-progress prediction, which we directly derive from the duration of the training demonstrations. We validate our method across three real-world tasks, each requiring multi-step, multi-object interactions. Despite the small dataset, our policies generalise robustly to unseen object appearances, geometries, and spatial arrangements, achieving high success rates without reliance on exhaustive training data. Video demonstration can be found on our anonymised project page: https://affordance-policy.github.io/.}

	abstract = {Robot-assisted dressing has the potential to significantly improve the lives of individuals with mobility impairments. To ensure an effective and comfortable dressing experience, the robot must be able to handle challenging deformable garments, apply appropriate forces, and adapt to limb movements throughout the dressing process. Prior work often makes simplifying assumptions---such as static human limbs during dressing---which limits real-world applicability. In this work, we develop a robot-assisted dressing system capable of handling partial observations with visual occlusions, as well as robustly adapting to arm motions during the dressing process. Given a policy trained in simulation with partial observations, we propose a method to fine-tune it in the real world using a small amount of data and multi-modal feedback from vision and force sensing, to further improve the policy's adaptability to arm motions and enhance safety. We evaluate our method in simulation with simplified articulated human meshes and in a real world human study with 12 participants across 264 dressing trials. Our policy successfully dresses two long-sleeve everyday garments onto the participants while being adaptive to various kinds of arm motions, and greatly outperforms prior baselines in terms of task completion and user feedback.}

	abstract = {Visual-textual understanding is essential for language-guided robot manipulation. Recent works leverage pre-trained vision-language models to measure the similarity between encoded visual observations and textual instructions, and then train a model to map this similarity to robot actions. However, this two-step approach limits the model to capture the relationship between visual observations and textual instructions, leading to reduced precision in manipulation tasks. We propose to learn visual-textual associations through a self-supervised pretext task: reconstructing a masked goal image conditioned on an input image and textual instructions. This formulation allows the model to learn visual-action representations without robot action supervision. The learned representations can then be fine-tuned for manipulation tasks with only a few demonstrations. We also introduce the \textit{Omni-Object Pick-and-Place} dataset, which consists of annotated robot tabletop manipulation episodes, including 180 object classes and 3,200 instances with corresponding textual instructions. This dataset enables the model to acquire diverse object priors and allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of its generalisation capability across object instances. Experimental results on the five benchmarks, including both simulated and real-robot validations, demonstrate that our method outperforms prior art.}

Recent vision foundation models, which are trained on a large corpus of
data, can serve as a good source of external prior knowledge to improve
generalization. We propose FOMO-3D, the first 3D detector
to leverage vision foundation models for long-tailed 3D detection. Specifically,
FOMO-3D exploits rich semantic and depth priors from OWLv2 and Metric3Dv2 within
a two-stage detection paradigm that first generates proposals with a
LiDAR-based branch and a novel camera-based branch, and refines them with
attention especially to image features from OWL. Evaluations on real-world
driving data show that using rich priors from vision
foundation models with careful multimodal fusion designs leads to large gains
for long-tailed 3D detection.}

	abstract = {In meta-learning and its downstream tasks, many methods use implicit adaptation to represent task-specific variations. However, implicit approaches hinder interpretability and make it difficult to understand which task factors drive performance. In this work, we introduce a disentangled multi-context meta-learning framework that explicitly learns separate context vectors for different aspects that define a task. By decoupling these factors, our approach improves both robustness, through deeper task understanding, and generalization, by enabling context vector sharing across tasks with the same context. We evaluate our approach in two domains. First, on a sinusoidal regression benchmark, our model outperforms baselines on out-of-distribution tasks and generalizes to unseen sine functions by sharing context vectors associated with shared amplitudes or phase shifts. Second, in a quadruped locomotion task, we disentangle the robot-specific properties and the characteristics of the terrain in the robot dynamics model. Using these context vectors in reinforcement learning, the learned policy demonstrates improved robustness under out-of-distribution conditions, compared to a model using a single unified context. Furthermore, by effectively sharing context, our model enables successful sim-to-real policy transfer to challenging terrains with out-of-distribution robot-specific properties using only real data from flat terrain, which is not achievable with single-task adaptation.}

We propose Fail2Progress, an approach that leverages Stein variational inference to generate multiple simulation environments in parallel, enabling efficient data sample generation similar to observed failures. Our method is capable of handling several challenging mobile manipulation tasks, including transporting multiple objects, organizing a constrained shelf, and tabletop organization. Through large-scale simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our approach excels at learning from failures across different numbers of objects. Furthermore, we show that Fail2Progress outperforms several baselines.}

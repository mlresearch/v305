title: 'Adapt3R: Adaptive 3D Scene Representation for Domain Transfer in Imitation
  Learning'
section: Poster
openreview: sUWOSP6SUJ
abstract: Imitation Learning can train robots to perform complex and diverse manipulation
  tasks, but learned policies are brittle with observations outside of the training
  distribution. 3D scene representations that incorporate observations from calibrated
  RGBD cameras have been proposed as a way to mitigate this, but in our evaluations
  with unseen embodiments and camera viewpoints they show only modest improvement.
  To address those challenges, we propose Adapt3R, a general-purpose 3D observation
  encoder which synthesizes data from calibrated RGBD cameras into a vector that can
  be used as conditioning for arbitrary IL algorithms. The key idea is to use a pretrained
  2D backbone to extract semantic information, using 3D only as a medium to localize
  this information with respect to the end-effector. We show across 93 simulated and
  6 real tasks that when trained end-to-end with a variety of IL algorithms, Adapt3R
  maintains these algorithmsâ€™ learning capacity while enabling zero-shot transfer
  to novel embodiments and camera poses. For more results, visit https://adapt3r-robot.github.io.

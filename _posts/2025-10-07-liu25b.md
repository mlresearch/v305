title: 'ImMimic: Cross-Domain Imitation from Human Videos via Mapping and Interpolation'
section: Oral
openreview: 7iaYcss56y
abstract: Learning robot manipulation from abundant human videos offers a scalable
  alternative to costly robot-specific data collection. However, domain gaps across
  visual, morphological, and physical aspects hinder direct imitation. To effectively
  bridge the domain gap, we propose ImMimic, an embodiment-agnostic co-training framework
  that leverages both human videos and a small amount of teleoperated robot demonstrations.
  ImMimic uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) with either action- or visual-based mapping
  to map retargeted human hand poses to robot joints, followed by MixUp interpolation
  between paired human and robot trajectories. Our key insights are (1) retargeted
  human hand trajectories provide informative action labels, and (2) interpolation
  over the mapped data creates intermediate domains that facilitate smooth domain
  adaptation during co-training. Evaluations on four real-world manipulation tasks
  (Pick and Place, Push, Hammer, Flip) across four robotic embodiments (Robotiq, Fin
  Ray, Allegro, Ability) show that ImMimic improves task success rates and execution
  smoothness, highlighting its efficacy to bridge the domain gap for robust robot
  manipulation. The project website can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/immimic.

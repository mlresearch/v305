  Models'

abstract: Learning real-world robotic manipulation is challenging, particularly when
  limited demonstrations are available. Existing methods for few-shot manipulation
  often rely on simulation-augmented data or pre-built modules like grasping and pose
  estimation, which struggle with sim-to-real gaps and lack extensibility. While large-scale
  imitation pre-training shows promise, adapting these general-purpose policies to
  specific tasks in data-scarce settings remains unexplored. To achieve this, we propose
  ControlVLA, a novel framework that bridges pre-trained VLA models with object-centric
  representations via a ControlNet-style architecture for efficient fine-tuning. Specifically,
  to introduce object-centric conditions without overwriting prior knowledge, ControlVLA
  zero-initializes a set of projection layers, allowing them to gradually adapt the
  pre-trained manipulation policies. In real-world experiments across 6 diverse tasks,
  including pouring cubes and folding clothes, our method achieves a 76.7% success
  rate while requiring only 10-20 demonstrations — a significant improvement over
  traditional approaches that require more than 100 demonstrations to achieve comparable
  success.  Additional experiments highlight ControlVLA’s extensibility to long-horizon
  tasks and robustness to unseen objects and backgrounds.

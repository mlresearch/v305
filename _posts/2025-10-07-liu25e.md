title: 'ReasonPlan: Unified Scene Prediction and Decision Reasoning for Closed-loop
  Autonomous Driving'
section: Poster
openreview: RqNpzq17kw
abstract: Due to the powerful vision-language reasoning and generalization abilities,
  multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have garnered significant attention in
  the field of end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving. However, their application to
  closed-loop systems remains underexplored, and current MLLM-based methods have not
  shown clear superiority to mainstream E2E imitation learning approaches. In this
  work, we propose ReasonPlan, a novel MLLM fine-tuning framework designed for closed-loop
  driving through holistic reasoning with a self-supervised Next Scene Prediction
  task and supervised Decision Chain-of-Thought process. This dual mechanism encourages
  the model to align visual representations with actionable driving context, while
  promoting interpretable and causally grounded decision making. We curate a planning-oriented
  decision reasoning dataset, namely PDR, comprising 210k diverse and high-quality
  samples. Our method outperforms the mainstream E2E imitation learning method by
  a large margin of 19% L2 and 16.1 driving score on Bench2Drive benchmark. Furthermore,
  ReasonPlan demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on unseen DOS benchmark,
  highlighting its adaptability in handling zero-shot corner cases.

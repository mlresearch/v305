title: 'FLARE: Robot Learning with Implicit World Modeling'
section: Poster
openreview: HXJ6pUSn1L
abstract: We introduce **F**uture **LA**tent **R**presentation Alignm**E**nt (**FLARE**),
  a novel framework that integrates predictive world modeling into robot policy learning.
  By aligning features from a diffusion transformer with latent embeddings of future
  observations, **FLARE** enables a diffusion transformer policy to anticipate latent
  representations of future observations, allowing it to reason about long-term consequences
  while generating actions. Remarkably lightweight, **FLARE** requires only minimal
  architectural modifications—adding a few tokens to standard vision-language-action
  (VLA) models—yet delivers substantial performance gains. Across two challenging
  multitask simulation imitation learning benchmarks spanning single-arm and humanoid
  tabletop manipulation, **FLARE** achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
  prior policy learning baselines by up to 26%. Moreover, **FLARE** unlocks the ability
  to co-train with human egocentric video demonstrations lacking action labels, significantly
  boosting policy generalization to a novel object with unseen geometry with as few
  as 1 robot demonstration. Our results establish **FLARE** as a general and scalable
  approach for combining implicit world modeling with high-frequency robotic control.

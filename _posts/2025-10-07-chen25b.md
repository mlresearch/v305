  Scenes'

abstract: Dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes presents significant challenges due
  to diverse object geometries, occlusions, and potential collisions. Existing methods
  primarily focus on single-object grasping or grasp-pose prediction without interaction,
  which are insufficient for complex, cluttered scenes. Recent vision-language-action
  models offer a potential solution but require extensive real-world demonstrations,
  making them costly and difficult to scale. To address these limitations, we revisit
  the sim-to-real transfer pipeline and develop key techniques that enable zero-shot
  deployment in reality while maintaining robust generalization. We propose ClutterDexGrasp,
  a two-stage teacher-student framework for closed-loop target-oriented dexterous
  grasping in cluttered scenes. The framework features a teacher policy trained in
  simulation using clutter density curriculum learning, incorporating both a novel
  geometry- and spatially-embedded scene representation and a comprehensive safety
  curriculum, enabling general, dynamic, and safe grasping behaviors. Through imitation
  learning, we distill the teacherâ€™s knowledge into a student 3D diffusion policy
  (DP3) that operates on partial point cloud observations. To the best of our knowledge,
  this represents the first zero-shot sim-to-real closed-loop system for target oriented
  dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes, demonstrating robust performance across
  diverse objects and layouts.

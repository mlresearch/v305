title: Sample-Efficient Online Control Policy Learning with Real-Time Recursive Model
  Updates
section: Poster
openreview: jr1Gjpjmqc
abstract: 'Data-driven control methods need to be sample-efficient and lightweight,
  especially when data acquisition and computational resources are limited—such as
  during learning on hardware. Most modern data-driven methods require large datasets
  and struggle with real-time updates of models, limiting their performance in dynamic
  environments. Koopman theory formally represents nonlinear systems as linear models
  over observables, and Koopman representations can be determined from data in an
  optimization-friendly setting with potentially rapid model updates. In this paper,
  we present a highly sample-efficient, Koopman-based learning pipeline: Recursive
  Koopman Learning (RKL). We identify sufficient conditions for model convergence
  and provide formal algorithmic analysis supporting our claim that RKL is lightweight
  and fast, with complexity independent of dataset size. We validate our method on
  a simulated planar two-link arm and a hybrid nonlinear hardware system with soft
  actuators, showing that real-time recursive Koopman model updates improve the sample
  efficiency and stability of data-driven controller synthesis—requiring only <10%
  of the data compared to benchmarks. The high-performance C++ codebase will be open-sourced.'

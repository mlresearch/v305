title: Latent Adaptive Planner for Dynamic Manipulation
section: Poster
openreview: bmpDAqsJov
abstract: This paper presents Latent Adaptive Planner (LAP), a novel approach for
  dynamic nonprehensile manipulation tasks that formulates planning as latent space
  inference, effectively learned from human demonstration videos.  Our method addresses
  key challenges in visuomotor policy learning through a principled variational replanning
  framework that maintains temporal consistency while efficiently adapting to environmental
  changes. LAP employs Bayesian updating in latent space to incrementally refine plans
  as new observations become available, striking an optimal balance between computational
  efficiency and real-time adaptability.  We bridge the embodiment gap between humans
  and robots through model-based proportional mapping that regenerates accurate kinematic-dynamic
  joint states and object positions from human demonstrations.  Experimental evaluations
  across multiple complex manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that LAP achieves state-of-the-art
  performance, outperforming existing approaches in success rate, trajectory smoothness,
  and energy efficiency, particularly in dynamic adaptation scenarios. Our approach
  enables robots to perform complex interactions with human-like adaptability while
  providing an expandable framework applicable to diverse robotic platforms using
  the same human demonstration videos.

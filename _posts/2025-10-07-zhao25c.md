title: Robot Learning from Any Images
section: Poster
openreview: FCHl2ybdAm
abstract: We introduce RoLA, a framework that transforms any in-the-wild image into
  an interactive, physics-enabled robotic environment.  Unlike previous methods, RoLA
  operates directly on a single image without requiring additional hardware or digital
  assets. Our framework democratizes robotic data generation by producing massive
  visuomotor robotic demonstrations within minutes from a wide range of image sources,
  including camera captures, robotic datasets, and Internet images. At its core, our
  approach combines a novel method for single-view physical scene recovery with an
  efficient visual blending strategy for photorealistic data collection. We demonstrate
  RoLAâ€™s versatility across applications like scalable robotic data generation and
  augmentation, robot learning from internet images, and single-image real-to-sim-to-real
  systems for manipulators and humanoids. Video results are available at our \href{https://rola-2025.github.io/}{project
  page}.

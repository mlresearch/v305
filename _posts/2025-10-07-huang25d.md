title: 'Fail2Progress: Learning from Real-World Robot Failures with Stein Variational
  Inference'
section: Poster
openreview: 06YyNxzwae
abstract: Skill effect models for long-horizon manipulation tasks are prone to failures
  in conditions not covered by training data distributions. Therefore, enabling robots
  to reason about and learn from failures is necessary. We investigate the problem
  of efficiently generating a dataset targeted to observed failures. After fine-tuning
  a skill effect model on this dataset, we evaluate the extent to which the model
  can recover from failures and minimize future failures. We propose Fail2Progress,
  an approach that leverages Stein variational inference to generate multiple simulation
  environments in parallel, enabling efficient data sample generation similar to observed
  failures. Our method is capable of handling several challenging mobile manipulation
  tasks, including transporting multiple objects, organizing a constrained shelf,
  and tabletop organization. Through large-scale simulation and real-world experiments,
  we demonstrate that our approach excels at learning from failures across different
  numbers of objects. Furthermore, we show that Fail2Progress outperforms several
  baselines.

title: 'ActLoc: Learning to Localize on the Move via Active Viewpoint Selection'
section: Poster
openreview: vLtS0ZDL73
abstract: Reliable localization is critical for robot navigation, yet many existing
  systems assume that all viewpoints along a trajectory are equally informative. In
  practice, localization becomes unreliable when the robot observes unmapped, ambiguous,
  or uninformative regions. To address this, we present ActLoc, an active viewpoint-aware
  planning framework for enhancing localization accuracy for general robot navigation
  tasks. At the core of ActLoc is an attention-based model trained at scale for viewpoint
  selection. This model encodes a metric map of the scene, along with camera poses
  used during map construction, and estimates localization accuracy over camera pitch
  and yaw directions at arbitrary 3D waypoint in space. This per-point accuracy distribution
  is integrated into the path planning process, allowing the robot to actively choose
  camera orientation that maximize localization robustness while respecting task and
  motion constraints. ActLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-viewpoint
  selection task, and generalizes effectively to full-trajectory planning. It provides
  a modular enhancement to a wide range of navigation and inspection tasks in structured
  environments.

title: Visual Imitation Enables Contextual Humanoid Control
section: Oral
openreview: C6VxzSpjrv
abstract: How can we teach humanoids to climb staircases and sit on chairs using the
  surrounding environment context? Arguably the simplest way is to _just show them_â€”casually
  capture a human motion video and feed it to humanoids. We introduce **VideoMimic**,
  a real-to-sim-to-real pipeline that mines everyday videos, jointly reconstructs
  the humans and the environment, and produces whole-body control policies for humanoid
  robots that perform the corresponding skills. We demonstrate the results of our
  pipeline on real humanoid robots, showing robust, repeatable contextual control
  such as staircase ascents and descents, sitting and standing from chairs and benches,
  as well as other dynamic whole-body skills all from a single policy, conditioned
  on the environment and global root commands. We hope our data and approach help
  enable a scalable path towards teaching humanoids to operate in diverse real-world
  environments.

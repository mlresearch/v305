title: Multimodal Fused Learning for Solving the Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem
  in Robotic Task Planning
section: Poster
openreview: r29CIl3ePP
abstract: Effective and efficient task planning is essential for mobile robots, especially
  in applications like warehouse retrieval and environmental monitoring. These tasks
  often involve selecting one location from each of several target clusters, forming
  a Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (GTSP) that remains challenging to solve
  both accurately and efficiently. To address this, we propose a Multimodal Fused
  Learning (MMFL) framework that leverages both graph and image-based representations
  to capture complementary aspects of the problem, and learns a policy capable of
  generating high-quality task planning schemes in real time. Specifically, we first
  introduce a coordinate-based image builder that transforms GTSP instances into spatially
  informative representations. We then design an adaptive resolution scaling strategy
  to enhance adaptability across different problem scales, and develop a multimodal
  fusion module with dedicated bottlenecks that enables effective integration of geometric
  and spatial features. Extensive experiments show that our MMFL approach significantly
  outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various GTSP instances while maintaining
  the computational efficiency required for real-time robotic applications. Physical
  robot tests further validate its practical effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

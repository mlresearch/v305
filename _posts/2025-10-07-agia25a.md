abstract: In robot imitation learning, policy performance is tightly coupled with
  the quality and composition of the demonstration data. Yet, developing a precise
  understanding of how individual demonstrations contribute to downstream outcomes—such
  as closed-loop task success or failure—remains a persistent challenge. Inspired
  by the theory of influence functions, we propose CUPID. Given a set of evaluation
  rollouts, CUPID estimates the influence of a training demonstration on the policy’s
  expected return. This enables ranking and selection of demonstrations according
  to their impact on the policy’s closed-loop performance. We use our estimator to
  curate data by 1) filtering out training demonstrations that harmed the policy’s
  performance and 2) subselecting newly collected trajectories that will most help
  improve the policy. Extensive simulated and hardware experiments show that our approach
  consistently identifies which data drives test-time performance. For example, training
  with less than 33% of curated data can result in state-of-the-art diffusion policies
  on the simulated Robomimic benchmark, and we observe similar improvements in hardware
  experiments. Furthermore, our hardware experiments show that our influence-based
  estimator can identify robust strategies under distribution shift, isolate spurious
  correlations, and even enhance post-training of generalist policies.

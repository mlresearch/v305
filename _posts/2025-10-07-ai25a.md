title: Towards Embodiment Scaling Laws in Robot Locomotion
section: Poster
openreview: Lv5lmtLGIQ
abstract: Developing generalist agents that operate across diverse tasks, environments,
  and robot embodiments is a grand challenge in robotics and artificial intelligence.
  While substantial progress has been made in cross-task and cross-environment generalization,
  achieving broad generalization to novel embodiments remains elusive. In this work,
  we study embodiment scaling laws â€” the hypothesis that increasing the quantity of
  training embodiments improves generalization to unseen ones. To explore this, we
  procedurally generate a dataset of $\sim$1,000 varied robot embodiments, spanning
  humanoids, quadrupeds, and hexapods, and train embodiment-specific reinforcement
  learning experts for legged locomotion. We then distill these experts into a single
  generalist policy capable of handling diverse observation and action spaces. Our
  large-scale study reveals that generalization performance improves with the number
  of training embodiments. Notably, a policy trained on the full dataset zero-shot
  transfers to diverse unseen embodiments in both simulation and real-world evaluations.
  These results provide preliminary empirical evidence for embodiment scaling laws
  and suggest that scaling up embodiment quantity may serve as a foundation for building
  generalist robot agents.

title: "$Door(s)$: Junction State Estimation for Efficient Exploration in Reinforcement
  Learning"
section: Poster
openreview: NtnPVwUCAH
abstract: Exploration is one of the important bottlenecks for efficient learning in
  reinforcement learning, especially in the presence of sparse rewards. One way to
  traverse the environment faster is by passing through junctions, or metaphorical
  doors, in the state space. We propose a novel heuristic, $Door(s)$, focused on such
  narrow passages that serve as pathways to a large number of other states. Our approach
  works by estimating the state occupancy distribution and allows computation of its
  entropy, which forms the basis for our measure. Its computation is more sample-efficient
  compared to other similar methods and robustly works over longer horizons. Our results
  highlight the detection of dead-end states, show increased exploration efficiency,
  and demonstrate that $Door(s)$ encodes specific behaviors useful for downstream
  learning of various robotic manipulation tasks.

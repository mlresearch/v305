title: 'VLM-AD: End-to-End Autonomous Driving through Vision-Language Model Supervision'
section: Poster
openreview: JM2vDI6DlP
abstract: Human drivers rely on commonsense reasoning to navigate diverse and dynamic
  real-world scenarios. Existing end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving (AD) models are
  typically optimized to mimic driving patterns observed in data, without capturing
  the underlying reasoning processes.  This limitation constrains their ability to
  handle challenging driving scenarios. To close this gap, we propose VLM-AD, a method
  that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) as teachers to enhance training by
  providing additional supervision that incorporates unstructured reasoning information
  and structured action labels. Such supervision enhances the modelâ€™s ability to learn
  richer feature representations that capture the rationale behind driving patterns.
  Importantly, our method does not require a VLM during inference, making it practical
  for real-time deployment. When integrated with state-of-the-art methods, VLM-AD
  achieves significant improvements in planning accuracy and reduced collision rates
  on the nuScenes dataset. It further improves route completion and driving scores
  under closed-loop evaluation, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-horizon, interactive
  driving scenarios and its potential for safe and reliable real-world deployment.

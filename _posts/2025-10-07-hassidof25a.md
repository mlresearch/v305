title: Train-Once Plan-Anywhere Kinodynamic Motion Planning via Diffusion Trees
section: Poster
openreview: lJWUourMTT
abstract: 'Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free
  trajectories while abiding by the robot’s dynamic constraints. This critical problem
  is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the robot’s high-dimensional
  state space by constructing a search tree via action propagations. Although SBPs
  can offer global guarantees on completeness and solution quality, their performance
  is often hindered by slow exploration due to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based
  approaches can yield significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize
  to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety,
  thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree (DiTree):
  a provably-generalizable framework leveraging diffusion policies (DPs) as informed
  samplers to efficiently guide state-space search within SBPs. DiTree  combines DP’s
  ability to model complex distributions of expert trajectories, conditioned on local
  observations, with the completeness of SBPs, to yield provably-safe solutions within
  a few action propagation iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate
  DiTree’s power with an implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP
  action sampler trained on a single environment. In comprehensive evaluations on
  OOD scenarios, DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (4x faster than
  classical SBPs), while improving the success rate over DP and SBPs (on average).'

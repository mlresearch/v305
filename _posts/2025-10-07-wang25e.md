title: 'CoRI: Communication of Robot Intent for Physical Human-Robot Interaction'
section: Poster
openreview: dBaSaa7qi4
abstract: Clear communication of robot intent fosters transparency and interpretability
  in physical human-robot interaction (pHRI), particularly during assistive tasks
  involving direct human-robot contact. We introduce CoRI, a pipeline that automatically
  generates natural language communication of a robot’s upcoming actions directly
  from its motion plan and visual perception. Our pipeline first processes the robot’s
  image view to identify human poses and key environmental features. It then encodes
  the planned 3D spatial trajectory (including velocity and force) onto this view,
  visually grounding the path and its dynamics. CoRI queries a vision-language model
  with this visual representation to interpret the planned action within the visual
  context before generating concise, user-directed statements, without relying on
  task-specific information. Results from a user study involving robot-assisted feeding,
  bathing, and shaving tasks across two different robots indicate that CoRI leads
  to statistically significant difference in communication clarity compared to a baseline
  communication strategy. Specifically, CoRI effectively conveys not only the robot’s
  high-level intentions but also crucial details about its motion and any collaborative
  user action needed.

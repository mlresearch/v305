title: 'The Sound of Simulation: Learning Multimodal Sim-to-Real Robot Policies with
  Generative Audio'
section: Oral
openreview: a9RXjOt5bU
abstract: Robots must integrate multiple sensory modalities to act effectively in
  the real world. Yet, learning such multimodal policies at scale remains challenging.
  Simulation offers a viable solution, but while vision has benefited from high-fidelity
  simulators, other modalities (e.g. sound) can be notoriously difficult to simulate.
  As a result, sim-to-real transfer has succeeded primarily in vision-based tasks,
  with multimodal transfer still largely unrealized. In this work, we tackle these
  challenges by introducing MultiGen, a framework that integrates large-scale generative
  models into traditional physics simulators, enabling multisensory simulation. We
  showcase our framework on the dynamic task of robot pouring, which inherently relies
  on multimodal feedback. By synthesizing realistic audio conditioned on simulation
  video, our method enables training on rich audiovisual trajectoriesâ€”without any
  real robot data. We demonstrate effective zero-shot transfer to real-world pouring
  with novel containers and liquids, highlighting the potential of generative modeling
  to both simulate hard-to-model modalities and close the multimodal sim-to-real gap.

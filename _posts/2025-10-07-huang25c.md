abstract: 3D world models (i.e., learning-based 3D dynamics models) offer a promising
  approach to generalizable robotic manipulation by capturing the underlying physics
  of environment evolution conditioned on robot actions. However, existing 3D world
  models are primarily limited to single-material dynamics using a particle-based
  Graph Neural Network model, and often require time-consuming 3D scene reconstruction
  to obtain 3D particle tracks for training. In this work, we present ParticleFormer,
  a Transformer-based point cloud world model trained with a hybrid point cloud reconstruction
  loss, supervising both global and local dynamics features in multi-material, multi-object
  robot interactions. ParticleFormer captures fine-grained multi-object interactions
  between rigid, deformable, and flexible materials, trained directly from real-world
  robot perception data without an elaborate scene reconstruction. We demonstrate
  the modelâ€™s effectiveness both in 3D scene forecasting tasks, and in downstream
  manipulation tasks using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) policy.  In addition,
  we extend existing dynamics learning benchmarks to include diverse multi-material,
  multi-object interaction scenarios. We validate our method on six simulation and
  three real-world experiments, where it consistently outperforms leading baselines
  by achieving superior dynamics prediction accuracy and less rollout error in downstream
  visuomotor tasks. Experimental videos are available at https://particleformer.github.io/.

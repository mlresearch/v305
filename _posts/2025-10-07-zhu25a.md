title: Versatile Loco-Manipulation through Flexible Interlimb Coordination
section: Oral
openreview: Spg25qkV81
abstract: The ability to flexibly leverage limbs for loco-manipulation is essential
  for enabling autonomous robots to operate in unstructured environments. Yet, prior
  work on loco-manipulation is often constrained to specific tasks or predetermined
  limb configurations. In this work, we present einforcement Learning for Interlimb
  Coordination (ReLIC), an approach that enables versatile loco-manipulation through
  flexible interlimb coordination. The key to our approach is an adaptive controller
  that seamlessly bridges the execution of manipulation motions and the generation
  of stable gaits based on task demands. Through the interplay between two controller
  modules, ReLIC dynamically assigns each limb for manipulation or locomotion and
  robustly coordinates them to achieve the task success. Using efficient reinforcement
  learning in simulation, ReLIC learns to perform stable gaits in accordance with
  the manipulation goals in the real world. To solve diverse and complex tasks, we
  further propose to interface the learned controller with different types of task
  specifications, including target trajectories, contact points, and natural language
  instructions. Evaluated on 12 real-world tasks that require diverse and complex
  coordination patterns, ReLIC demonstrates its versatility and robustness by achieving
  a success rate of 78.9% on average.

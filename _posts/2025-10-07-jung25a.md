title: "$\\textttSPIN$: distilling $\\textttSkill-RRT$ for long-horizon prehensile
  and non-prehensile manipulation"
section: Poster
openreview: udH3b2Lsx5
abstract: Current robots struggle with long-horizon manipulation tasks requiring sequences
  of prehensile and non-prehensile skills, contact-rich interactions, and long-term
  reasoning. We present $\texttt{SPIN}$ ($\textbf{S}$kill $\textbf{P}$lanning to $\textbf{IN}$ference),
  a framework that distills a computationally intensive planning algorithm into a
  policy via imitation learning. We propose $\texttt{Skill-RRT}$, an extension of
  RRT that incorporates skill applicability checks and intermediate object pose sampling
  for solving such long-horizon problems. To chain independently trained skills, we
  introduce $\textit{connectors}$, goal-conditioned policies trained to minimize object
  disturbance during transitions. High-quality demonstrations are generated with $\texttt{Skill-RRT}$
  and distilled through noise-based replay in order to reduce online computation time.
  The resulting policy, trained entirely in simulation, transfers zero-shot to the
  real world and achieves over 80% success across three challenging long-horizon manipulation
  tasks and outperforms state-of-the-art hierarchical RL and planning methods.

  In-hand Pose Estimation'

abstract: Accurate estimation of the in-hand pose of an object based on its CAD model
  is crucial in both industrial applications and everyday tasksâ€”ranging from positioning
  workpieces and assembling components to seamlessly inserting devices like USB connectors.
  While existing methods often rely on regression, feature matching, or registration
  techniques, achieving high precision and generalizability to unseen CAD models remains
  a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel three-stage framework
  for in-hand pose estimation. The first stage involves sampling and pre-ranking pose
  candidates, followed by iterative refinement of these candidates in the second stage.
  In the final stage, post-ranking is applied to identify the most likely pose candidates.
  These stages are governed by a unified energy-based diffusion model, which is trained
  solely on simulated data. This energy model simultaneously generates gradients to
  refine pose estimates and produces an energy scalar that quantifies the quality
  of the pose estimates. Additionally, inspired by the computer vision domain, we
  incorporate a render-compare architecture within the energy-based score network
  to significantly enhance sim-to-real performance, as demonstrated by our ablation
  studies. Extensive experimental evaluations show that our method outperforms conventional
  baselines based on regression, matching, and registration techniques, while also
  exhibiting strong generalization to previously unseen CAD models. Moreover, our
  approach integrates tactile object pose estimation, pose tracking, and uncertainty
  estimation into a unified system, enabling robust performance across a variety of
  real-world conditions.

title: 'ReWiND: Language-Guided Rewards Teach Robot Policies without New Demonstrations'
section: Oral
openreview: XjjXLxfPou
abstract: 'We introduce ReWiND, a framework for learning robot manipulation tasks
  solely from language instructions without per-task demonstrations. Standard reinforcement
  learning (RL) and imitation learning methods require expert supervision through
  human-designed reward functions or demonstrations for every new task. In contrast,
  ReWiND starts from a small demonstration dataset to learn: (1) a data-efficient,
  language-conditioned reward function that labels the dataset with rewards, and (2)
  a language-conditioned policy pre-trained with offline RL using these rewards. Given
  an unseen task variation, ReWiND fine-tunes the pre-trained policy using the learned
  reward function, requiring minimal online interaction. We show that ReWiNDâ€™s reward
  model generalizes effectively to unseen tasks, outperforming baselines by up to
  2.4X in reward generalization and policy alignment metrics. Finally, we demonstrate
  that ReWiND enables sample-efficient adaptation to new tasks in both simulation
  and on a real bimanual manipulation platform, taking a step towards scalable, real-world
  robot learning.'

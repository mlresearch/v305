title: 'COMBO-Grasp: Learning Constraint-Based Manipulation for Bimanual Occluded
  Grasping'
section: Poster
openreview: xpEjjGC82v
abstract: 'This paper addresses the challenge of occluded robot grasping, i.e. grasping
  in situations where the desired grasp poses are kinematically infeasible due to
  environmental constraints such as surface collisions. Existing RL methods struggle
  with task complexity, and collecting expert demonstrations is often impractical.
  Instead, inspired by human bimanual manipulation strategies, where two hands coordinate
  to stabilise and reorient objects, we focus on a bimanual robotic setup to tackle
  this challenge. In particular, we introduce Constraint-based Manipulation for Bimanual
  Occluded Grasping (COMBO-Grasp), an approach which leverages two coordinated policies:
  a constraint policy trained using self-supervised datasets to generate stabilising
  poses and a grasping policy trained using RL that reorients and grasps the target
  object. A key contribution lies in value function-guided policy coordination, where
  gradients from a jointly trained value function refine the constraint policy during
  RL training to improve bimanual coordination and task performance. Lastly, COMBO-Grasp
  employs teacher-student policy distillation to effectively deploy vision-based policies
  in real-world environments. Experiments show that COMBO-Grasp significantly outperforms
  baselines and generalises to unseen objects in both simulation and real environments.'

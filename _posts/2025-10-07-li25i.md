title: 'Hold My Beer: Learning Gentle Humanoid Locomotion and End-Effector Stabilization
  Control'
section: Poster
openreview: Bl2VfU9NhF
abstract: 'Can your humanoid walk up and hand you a full cup of beer—without spilling
  a drop? While humanoids are increasingly featured in flashy demos—dancing, delivering
  packages, traversing rough terrain—fine-grained control during locomotion remains
  a significant challenge. In particular, stabilizing a filled end-effector (EE) while
  walking is far from solved, due to a fundamental mismatch in task dynamics: locomotion
  demands slow-timescale, robust control, whereas EE stabilization requires rapid,
  high-precision corrections. To address this, we propose SoFTA, a Slow-Fast Two-Agent
  framework that decouples upper-body and lower-body control into separate agents
  operating at different frequencies and with distinct rewards. This temporal and
  objective separation mitigates policy interference mitagates objective conflict
  and enables coordinated whole-body behavior. SoFTA executes upper-body actions at
  100 Hz for precise EE control and lower-body actions at 50 Hz for robust gait. It
  reduces EE acceleration by 2-5x to baselines and performs 2–3x closer to human-level
  stability, enabling delicate tasks such as carrying nearly full cups, capturing
  steady video during locomotion, and disturbance rejection with EE stability.'

title: Uncertainty-aware Latent Safety Filters for Avoiding Out-of-Distribution Failures
section: Poster
openreview: CQKxhmLobo
abstract: Recent advances in generative world models have enabled classical safe control
  methods, such as Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability, to generalize to complex robotic
  systems operating directly from high-dimensional sensor observations. However, obtaining
  comprehensive coverage of all safety-critical scenarios during world model training
  is extremely challenging. As a result, latent safety filters built on top of these
  models may miss novel hazards and even fail to prevent known ones, overconfidently
  misclassifying risky out-of-distribution (OOD) situations as safe. To address this,
  we introduce an uncertainty-aware latent safety filter that proactively steers robots
  away from both known and unseen failures. Our key idea is to use the world model’s
  epistemic uncertainty as a proxy for identifying unseen potential hazards. We propose
  a principled method to detect OOD world model predictions by calibrating an uncertainty
  threshold via conformal prediction. By performing reachability analysis in an augmented
  state space—spanning both the latent representation and the epistemic uncertainty—we
  synthesize a latent safety filter that can reliably safeguard arbitrary policies
  from both known and unseen safety hazards. In simulation and hardware experiments
  on vision-based control tasks with a Franka manipulator, we show that our uncertainty-aware
  safety filter preemptively detects potential unsafe scenarios and reliably proposes
  safe, in-distribution actions.

title: 'Learning from 10 Demos: Generalisable and Sample-Efficient Policy Learning
  with Oriented Affordance Frames'
section: Poster
openreview: 1K3kjo91Q1
abstract: 'Imitation learning has unlocked the potential for robots to exhibit highly
  dexterous behaviours. However, it still struggles with long-horizon, multi-object
  tasks due to poor sample efficiency and limited generalisation. Existing methods
  require a substantial number of demonstrations to cover possible task variations,
  making them costly and often impractical for real-world deployment.  We address
  this challenge by introducing \emph{oriented affordance frames}, a structured representation
  for state and action spaces that improves spatial and intra-category generalisation
  and enables policies to be learned efficiently from only 10 demonstrations. More
  importantly, we show how this abstraction allows for compositional generalisation
  of independently trained sub-policies to solve long-horizon, multi-object tasks.
  To seamlessly transition between sub-policies, we introduce the notion of self-progress
  prediction, which we directly derive from the duration of the training demonstrations.
  We validate our method across three real-world tasks, each requiring multi-step,
  multi-object interactions. Despite the small dataset, our policies generalise robustly
  to unseen object appearances, geometries, and spatial arrangements, achieving high
  success rates without reliance on exhaustive training data. Video demonstration

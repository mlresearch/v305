title: 'QuaDreamer: Controllable Panoramic Video Generation for Quadruped Robots'
section: Poster
openreview: najxw1MlZH
abstract: Panoramic cameras, capturing comprehensive 360-degree environmental data,
  are suitable for quadruped robots in surrounding perception and interaction with
  complex environments. However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training data
  — caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration challenges
  — fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems tailored to
  these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose QuaDreamer—the first
  panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for quadruped robots. QuaDreamer
  focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of quadruped robots to generate highly
  controllable, realistic panoramic videos, providing a data source for downstream
  tasks. Specifically, to effectively capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics
  exhibited during quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE).
  VJE extracts controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering
  and provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video generation
  under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller (SOC) that effectively
  manages object motion and boosts background jitter control through the attention
  mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in wide-FoV video generation, we propose
  the Panoramic Enhancer (PE) – a dual-stream architecture that synergizes frequency-texture
  refinement for local detail enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global
  geometric consistency. We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences
  can serve as training data for the quadruped robot’s panoramic visual perception
  model, enhancing the performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes.
  The source code and model weights will be publicly available.

  and Learning'

abstract: Multi-part assembly poses significant challenges for robotic systems to
  execute long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation with generalization across complex
  geometries. We present a dual-arm robotic system capable of end-to-end planning
  and control for autonomous assembly of general multi-part objects. For planning
  over long horizons, we develop hierarchies of precedence, sequence, grasp, and motion
  planning with automated fixture generation, enabling general multi-step assembly
  on any dual-arm robots. The planner is made efficient through a parallelizable design
  and is optimized for downstream control stability. For contact-rich assembly steps,
  we propose a lightweight reinforcement learning framework that trains generalist
  policies across object geometries, assembly directions, and grasp poses, guided
  by equivaraiance and residual actions obtained from the plan. These policies transfer
  zero-shot to the real world and achieve 80% success rates. For systematic evaluation,
  we propose a benchmark suite of multi-part assemblies resembling industrial and
  daily objects across diverse categories and geometries. By integrating efficient
  global planning and robust local control, we demonstrate the first system to achieve
  complete and generalizable real-world multi-part assembly without domain knowledge
  or human demonstrations.

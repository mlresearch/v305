  Correspondence'

abstract: 'End-to-end visuomotor policies trained using behavior cloning have shown
  a remarkable ability to generate complex, multi-modal low-level robot behaviors.
  However, at deployment time, these policies still struggle to act reliably when
  faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) visuals induced by objects, backgrounds, or
  environment changes. Prior works in interactive imitation learning solicit corrective
  expert demonstrations under the OOD conditionsâ€”but this can be costly and inefficient.
  We observe that task success under OOD conditions does not always warrant novel
  robot behaviors. In-distribution (ID) behaviors can directly be transferred to OOD
  conditions that share functional similarities with ID conditions. For example, behaviors
  trained to interact with in-distribution (ID) pens can apply to interacting with
  a visually-OOD pencil. The key challenge lies in disambiguating which ID observations
  functionally correspond to the OOD observation for the task at hand. We propose
  that an expert can provide this OOD-to-ID functional correspondence. Thus, instead
  of collecting new demonstrations and re-training at every OOD encounter, our method:
  (1) detects the need for feedback by checking if current observations are OOD and
  the most similar training observations show divergent behaviors (2) solicits functional
  correspondence feedback to disambiguate between those behaviors, and (3) intervenes
  on the OOD observations with the functionally corresponding ID observations to perform
  deployment-time generalization. We validate our method across diverse real-world
  robotic manipulation tasks with a Franka Panda robotic manipulator. Our results
  show that test-time functional correspondences can improve the generalization of
  a vision-based diffusion policy to OOD objects and environment conditions with low
  feedback.'

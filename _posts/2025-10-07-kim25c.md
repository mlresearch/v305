  Repulsive Estimation'

abstract: We propose CARE (Collision Avoidance via Repulsive Estimation) for improving
  the robustness of learning-based visual navigation methods. Recently, visual navigation
  models, particularly foundation models, have demonstrated promising performance
  by generating viable trajectories using only RGB images. However, these policies
  can generalize poorly to environments containing out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes
  characterized by unseen objects or different camera setups (e.g., variations in
  field of view, camera pose, or focal length). Without fine-tuning, such models could
  produce trajectories that lead to collisions, necessitating substantial efforts
  in data collection and additional training. To address this limitation, we introduce
  CARE, an attachable module that enhances the safety of visual navigation without
  requiring additional range sensors or fine-tuning of pretrained models. CARE can
  be integrated seamlessly into any RGB-based navigation model that generates local
  robot trajectories. It dynamically adjusts trajectories produced by a pretrained
  model using repulsive force vectors computed from depth images estimated directly
  from RGB inputs.  We evaluate CARE by integrating it with state-of-the-art visual
  navigation models across diverse robot platforms. Real-world experiments show that
  CARE significantly reduces collisions (up to 100%) without compromising navigation
  performance in goal-conditioned navigation, and further improves collision-free
  travel distance (up to 10.7$\times$) in exploration tasks.

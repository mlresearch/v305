title: Off Policy Lyapunov Stability in Reinforcement Learning
section: Poster
openreview: GfEHkeEU73
abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning lacks the ability to provide stability
  guarantees. More recent algorithms learn Lyapunov functions alongside the control
  policies to ensure stable learning. However, the current self-learned Lyapunov functions
  are sample inefficient due to their on-policy nature. This paper introduces a method
  for learning Lyapunov functions off-policy and incorporates the proposed off-policy
  Lyapunov function into the Soft Actor Critic and Proximal Policy Optimization algorithms
  to provide them with a data efficient stability certificate. Simulations of an inverted
  pendulum and a quadrotor illustrate the improved performance of the two algorithms
  when endowed with the proposed off-policy Lyapunov function.

abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a promising solution
  for learning complex and scalable coordination behaviors in multi-robot systems.
  However, established MARL platforms (e.g., SMAC and MPE) lack robotics relevance
  and hardware deployment, leaving multi-robot learning researchers to develop bespoke
  environments and hardware testbeds dedicated to the development and evaluation of
  their individual contributions. The Multi-Agent RL Benchmark and Learning Environment
  for the Robotarium (MARBLER) is an exciting recent step in providing a standardized
  robotics-relevant platform for MARL, by bridging the Robotarium testbed with existing
  MARL software infrastructure. However, MARBLER lacks support for parallelization
  and GPU/TPU execution, making the platform prohibitively slow compared to modern
  MARL environments and hindering adoption. We contribute JaxRobotarium, a  Jax-powered
  end-to-end simulation, learning, deployment, and benchmarking platform for the Robotarium.
  JaxRobotarium enables rapid training and deployment of multi-robot reinforcement
  learning (MRRL) policies with realistic robot dynamics and safety constraints, supporting
  both parallelization and hardware acceleration. Our generalizable learning interface
  provides an easy-to-use integration with SOTA MARL libraries (e.g., JaxMARL). In
  addition, JaxRobotarium includes eight standardized coordination scenarios, including
  four novel scenarios that bring established MARL benchmark tasks (e.g., RWARE and
  Level-Based Foraging) to a realistic robotics setting. We demonstrate that JaxRobotarium
  retains high simulation fidelity while achieving dramatic speedups over baseline
  (20x in training and 150x in simulation), and provides an open-access sim-to-real
  evaluation pipeline through the Robotarium testbed, accelerating and democratizing
  access to multi-robot learning research and evaluation.

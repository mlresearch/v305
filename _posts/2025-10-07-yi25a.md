title: Co-Design of Soft Gripper with Neural Physics
section: Poster
openreview: EBcb4LemZZ
abstract: For robot manipulation, both the controller and end-effector design are
  crucial. Compared with rigid grippers, soft grippers are more generalizable by deforming
  to different geometries, but designing such a gripper and finding its grasp pose
  remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a co-design framework that generates
  an optimized soft gripperâ€™s block-wise stiffness distribution and its grasping pose,
  using a neural physics model trained in simulation. We adopt a uniform-pressure
  tendon model, then generate a diverse dataset by randomizing both gripper pose and
  design parameters. A neural network is trained to approximate this forward simulation,
  yielding a fast, differentiable surrogate. We embed that surrogate in an end-to-end
  optimization loop to recover the ideal stiffness configuration and best grasp pose.
  Finally, we 3D-print the optimized grippers of various stiffness by changing the
  printing infills and parameters. We demonstrate that our co-designed grippers significantly
  outperform baseline designs in terms of force closure and success rate.

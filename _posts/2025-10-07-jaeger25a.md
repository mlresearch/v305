title: 'CaRL: Learning Scalable Planning Policies with Simple Rewards'
section: Poster
openreview: 1otaE496Vm
abstract: 'We investigate reinforcement learning (RL) for privileged planning in autonomous
  driving.  State-of-the-art approaches for this task are rule-based, but these methods
  do not scale to the long tail. RL, on the other hand, is scalable and does not suffer
  from compounding errors like imitation learning. Contemporary RL approaches for
  driving use complex shaped rewards that sum multiple individual rewards, \eg progress,
  position, or orientation rewards.  We show that PPO fails to optimize a popular
  version of these rewards when the mini-batch size is increased, which limits the
  scalability of these approaches. Instead, we propose a new reward design based primarily
  on optimizing a single intuitive reward term: route completion.  Infractions are
  penalized by terminating the episode or multiplicatively reducing route completion.
  We find that PPO scales well with higher mini-batch sizes when trained with our
  simple reward, even improving performance. Training with large mini-batch sizes
  enables efficient scaling via distributed data parallelism.  We scale PPO to 300M
  samples in CARLA and 500M samples in nuPlan with a single 8-GPU node. The resulting
  model achieves 64 DS on the CARLA longest6 v2 benchmark, outperforming other RL
  methods with more complex rewards by a large margin. Requiring only minimal adaptations
  from its use in CARLA, the same method is the best learning-based approach on nuPlan.
  It scores 91.3 in non-reactive and 90.6 in reactive traffic on the Val14 benchmark
  while being an order of magnitude faster than prior work.'

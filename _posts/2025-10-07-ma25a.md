title: 'Constraint-Aware Diffusion Guidance for Robotics: Real-Time Obstacle Avoidance
  for Autonomous Racing'
section: Poster
openreview: nryBWao01j
abstract: Diffusion models hold great potential in robotics due to their ability to
  capture complex, high-dimensional data distributions. However, their lack of constraint-awareness
  limits their deployment in safety-critical applications. We propose Constraint-Aware
  Diffusion Guidance (CoDiG), a data-efficient and general-purpose framework that
  integrates barrier functions into the denoising process, guiding diffusion sampling
  toward constraint-satisfying outputs. CoDiG enables constraint satisfaction even
  with limited training data and generalizes across tasks. We evaluate our framework
  in the challenging setting of miniature autonomous racing, where real-time obstacle
  avoidance is essential. Real-world experiments show that CoDiG generates safe outputs
  efficiently under dynamic conditions, highlighting its potential for broader robotic
  applications.

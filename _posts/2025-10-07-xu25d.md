  Scoped Exploration'

abstract: 'Hand–object motion-capture (MoCap) repositories provide abundant, contact-rich
  human demonstrations for scaling dexterous manipulation on robots. Yet demonstration
  inaccuracy and embodiment gaps between human and robot hands challenge direct policy
  learning. Existing pipelines adapt a three-stage workflow: retargeting, tracking,
  and residual correction. This multi-step process may not fully utilize demonstrations
  and can introduce compound errors. We introduce Reference-Scoped Exploration (RSE),
  a unified, single-loop optimization that integrates retargeting and tracking to
  train a scalable robot control policy directly from MoCap. Instead of treating demonstrations
  as strict ground truth, we view them as soft guidance. From raw demonstrations,
  we construct adaptive spatial scopes—time-varying termination boundaries, and reinforcement
  learning promotes the policy to stay within these envelopes while minimizing control
  effort. This holistic approach preserves demonstration intent, lets robot-specific
  strategies emerge, boosts robustness to noise, and scales effortlessly with large-scale
  demonstrations. We distill the scaled tracking policy into a vision-based, skill-conditioned
  generative control policy. This distilled policy captures diverse manipulation skills
  within a rich latent representation, enabling generalization across various objects
  and real-world robotic manipulation.'

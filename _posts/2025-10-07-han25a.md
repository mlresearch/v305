title: 'Wheeled Lab: Modern Sim2Real for Low-cost, Open-source Wheeled Robotics'
section: Poster
openreview: zxnUgr88rd
abstract: 'Simulation has been pivotal in recent robotics milestones and is poised
  to play a prominent role in the fieldâ€™s future. However, recent robotic advances
  often rely on expensive and high-maintenance platforms, limiting access to broader
  robotics audiences. This work introduces Wheeled Lab, a framework for integrating
  the low-cost, open-source wheeled platforms that are already widely established
  in education and research with Isaac Lab, an open-source, widely adopted, and rapidly
  growing simulation framework for robotics research. Wheeled Lab thus introduces
  to new user communities modern techniques in Sim2Real, such as domain randomization,
  sensor simulation, and end-to-end learning. To kickstart educational uses, we demonstrate
  three state-of-the-art policies for small-scale RC cars: controlled drifting, elevation
  traversal, and visual navigation, each trained and deployed through zero-shot reinforcement
  learning. By bridging the gap between advanced Sim2Real methods and affordable,
  available robotics, Wheeled Lab aims to democratize access to cutting-edge tools,
  fostering innovation and education in a broader robotics context. The full stack,
  from hardware to software, is low cost and open-source.'

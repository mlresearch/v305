title: Estimating Value of Assistance for Online POMDP Robotic Agents
section: Poster
openreview: xzR8rBRgPp
abstract: Robotic agents operating in dynamic, partially observable environments often
  benefit from teammate assistance. We address the challenge of determining when and
  how to assist in multi-robot systems where agents can modify the physical environment,
  such as moving obstacles that block perception or manipulation. For robots using
  online POMDP planning, evaluating assistance impacts requires computationally intensive
  policy evaluation, making real-time decisions difficult. We formulate Value of Assistance
  (VOA) for POMDP agents and develop efficient heuristics that approximate VOA without
  requiring complete policy evaluation. Our empirical evaluation on both a standard
  POMDP benchmark and a collaborative manipulation task demonstrates that our Full
  Information heuristic enables real-time assistance decisions while maintaining sufficient
  accuracy for effective helping action selection.

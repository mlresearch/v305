  Manipulation'

abstract: Building robotic agents capable of operating across diverse environments
  and object types remains a significant challenge, often requiring extensive data
  collection. This is particularly restrictive in robotics, where each data point
  must be physically executed in the real world. Consequently, there is a critical
  need for alternative data sources for robotics and frameworks that enable learning
  from such data. In this work, we present Point Policy, a new method for learning
  robot policies exclusively from offline human demonstration videos without any teleoperation
  data. Point Policy leverages state-of-the-art vision models and policy architectures
  to translate human hand poses into robot poses while capturing object states through
  semantically meaningful key points. This approach yields a morphology-agnostic representation
  that facilitates effective policy learning. Through experiments on a diverse set
  of real-world tasks, we demonstrate that Point Policy significantly outperforms
  prior methods for policy learning from human videos, performing well not only within
  the training distribution but also generalizing to novel object instances and cluttered
  environments. Videos of the robot are best viewed at anon-point-policy.github.io.

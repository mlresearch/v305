title: Real-Time Out-of-Distribution Failure Prevention via Multi-Modal Reasoning
section: Oral
openreview: hh9afiQMb2
abstract: Foundation models can provide robust high-level reasoning on appropriate
  safety interventions in hazardous scenarios beyond a robotâ€™s training data, i.e.
  out-of-distribution (OOD) failures. However, due to the high inference latency of
  Large Vision and Language Models, current methods rely on manually defined intervention
  policies to enact fallbacks, thereby lacking the ability to plan generalizable,
  semantically safe motions. To overcome these challenges we present FORTRESS, a framework
  that generates and reasons about semantically safe fallback strategies in real time
  to prevent OOD failures. At a low frequency in nominal operations, FORTRESS uses
  multi-modal reasoners to identify goals and anticipate failure modes. When a runtime
  monitor triggers a fallback response, FORTRESS rapidly synthesizes plans to fallback
  goals while inferring and avoiding semantically unsafe regions in real time. By
  bridging open-world, multi-modal reasoning with dynamics-aware planning, we eliminate
  the need for hard-coded fallbacks and human safety interventions. FORTRESS outperforms
  on-the-fly prompting of slow reasoning models in safety classification accuracy
  on synthetic benchmarks and real-world ANYmal robot data, and further improves system
  safety and planning success in simulation and on quadrotor hardware for urban navigation.

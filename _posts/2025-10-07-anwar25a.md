title: Efficient Evaluation of Multi-Task Robot Policies With Active Experiment Selection
section: Poster
openreview: pJ5FONkM9N
abstract: Evaluating learned robot control policies to determine their performance
  costs the experimenter time and effort. As robots become more capable in accomplishing
  diverse tasks, evaluating across all these tasks becomes more difficult as it is
  impractical to test every policy on every task multiple times. Rather than considering
  the average performance of a policy on a task, we consider the distribution of performance
  over time. In a multi-task policy evaluation setting, we actively model the distribution
  of robot performance across multiple tasks and policies as we sequentially execute
  experiments. We show that natural language is a useful prior in modeling relationships
  between tasks because they often share similarities that can reveal potential relationships
  in policy behavior. We leverage this formulation to reduce experimenter effort by
  using a cost-aware information gain heuristic to efficiently select informative
  trials. We conduct experiments on existing evaluation data from real robots and
  simulations and find a 50% reduction in estimates of the mean performance given
  a fixed cost budget. We encourage the use of our surrogate model as a scalable approach
  to track progress in evaluation.

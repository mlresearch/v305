title: 'KineDex: Learning Tactile-Informed Visuomotor Policies via Kinesthetic Teaching
  for Dexterous Manipulation'

abstract: Collecting demonstrations enriched with fine-grained tactile information
  is critical for dexterous manipulation, particularly in contact-rich tasks that
  require precise force control and physical interaction. While prior works primarily
  focus on teleoperation or video-based retargeting, they often suffer from kinematic
  mismatches and the absence of real-time tactile feedback, hindering the acquisition
  of high-fidelity tactile data. To mitigate this issue, we propose KineDex, a hand-over-hand
  kinesthetic teaching paradigm in which the operatorâ€™s motion is directly transferred
  to the dexterous hand, enabling the collection of physically grounded demonstrations
  enriched with accurate tactile feedback. To resolve occlusions from human hand,
  we apply inpainting technique to preprocess the visual observations. Based on these
  demonstrations, we then train a visuomotor policy using tactile-augmented inputs
  and implement force control during deployment for precise contact-rich manipulation.
  We evaluate KineDex on a suite of challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks, including
  particularly difficult scenarios such as squeezing toothpaste onto a toothbrush,
  which require precise multi-finger coordination and stable force regulation. Across
  these tasks, KineDex achieves an average success rate of 74.4%, representing a 57.7%
  improvement over the variant without force control. Comparative experiments with
  teleoperation and user studies further validate the advantages of KineDex in data
  collection efficiency and operability. Specifically, KineDex collects data over
  twice as fast as teleoperation across two tasks of varying difficulty, while maintaining
  a near-100% success rate, compared to under 50% for teleoperation.

title: 'OPAL: Visibility-aware LiDAR-to-OpenStreetMap Place Recognition via Adaptive
  Radial Fusion'
section: Poster
openreview: DKXx17oaUf
abstract: LiDAR place recognition is a critical capability for autonomous navigation
  and cross-modal localization in large-scale outdoor environments. Existing approaches
  predominantly depend on pre-built 3D dense maps or aerial imagery, which impose
  significant storage overhead and lack real-time adaptability. In this paper, we
  propose OPAL, a novel network for LiDAR place recognition that leverages OpenStreetMap
  (OSM) as a lightweight and up-to-date prior. Our key innovation lies in bridging
  the domain disparity between sparse LiDAR scans and structured OSM data through
  two carefully designed components. First, a cross-modal visibility mask that identifies
  maximal observable regions from both modalities to guide feature learning. Second,
  an adaptive radial fusion module that dynamically consolidates radial features into
  discriminative global descriptors. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and KITTI-360
  datasets demonstrate OPALâ€™s superiority, achieving 15.98% higher recall at  @1m
  threshold for top-1 retrieved matches, along with 12x faster inference speed compared
  to the state-of-the-art approach. Code and datasets will be publicly available.

title: Learning Smooth State-Dependent Traversability from Dense Point Clouds
section: Poster
openreview: oYC10hiFua
abstract: A key open challenge in off-road autonomy is that the traversability of
  terrain often depends on the vehicleâ€™s state. In particular, some obstacles are
  only traversable from some orientations. However, learning this interaction by encoding
  the angle of approach as a model input demands a large and diverse training dataset
  and is computationally inefficient during planning due to repeated model inference.
  To address these challenges, we present SPARTA, a method for estimating approach
  angle conditioned traversability from point clouds. Specifically, we impose geometric
  structure into our network by outputting a smooth analytical function over the 1-Sphere
  that predicts risk distribution for any angle of approach with minimal overhead
  and can be reused for subsequent queries. The function is composed of Fourier basis
  functions, which has important advantages for generalization due to their periodic
  nature and smoothness. We demonstrate SPARTA both in a high-fidelity simulation
  platform, where our model achieves a 91% success rate crossing a 40m boulder field
  (compared to 73% for the baseline), and on hardware, illustrating the generalization
  ability of the model to real-world settings.

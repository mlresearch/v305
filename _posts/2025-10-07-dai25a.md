title: 'AimBot: A Simple Auxiliary Visual Cue to Enhance Spatial Awareness of Visuomotor
  Policies'
section: Poster
openreview: brTSiML1nh
abstract: In this paper, we propose AimBot, a lightweight visual augmentation technique
  that provides explicit spatial cues to improve visuomotor policy learning in robotic
  manipulation. AimBot overlays shooting lines and scope reticles onto multi-view
  RGB images, offering auxiliary visual guidance that encodes the end-effectorâ€™s state.
  The overlays are computed from depth images, camera extrinsics, and the current
  end-effector pose, explicitly conveying spatial relationships between the gripper
  and objects in the scene. AimBot incurs minimal computational overhead (less than
  1 ms) and requires no changes to model architectures, as it simply replaces original
  RGB images with augmented counterparts. Despite its simplicity, our results show
  that AimBot consistently improves the performance of various visuomotor policies
  in both simulation and real-world settings, highlighting the benefits of spatially
  grounded visual feedback. More videos can be found at https://aimbot-reticle.github.io/

title: 'ManiFlow: A General Robot Manipulation Policy via Consistency Flow Training'
section: Poster
openreview: etSYDtRO0Z
abstract: Generative models based on flow matching offer significant potential for
  learning robot policies, particularly in generating high-dimensional, dexterous
  behaviors that are conditioned on diverse observations. In this work, we introduce
  ManiFlow, an advanced flow matching model specifically designed to support dexterous
  manipulation tasks. ManiFlow improves over flow matching both in the learning procedure
  and in the model architecture, resulting in better robustness and efficacy. It consistently
  exhibits strong generalization capabilities, outperforming existing state-of-the-art
  robot learning methods on a wide range of benchmarks. We also demonstrate the powerful
  capabilities of ManiFlow in solving complex bimanual dexterous manipulation challenges.

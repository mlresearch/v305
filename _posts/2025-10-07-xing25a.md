title: 'Shortcut Learning in Generalist Robot Policies: The Role of Dataset Diversity
  and Fragmentation'
section: Poster
openreview: PTJopl2uaU
abstract: 'Generalist robot policies trained on large-scale datasets such as Open
  X-Embodiment (OXE) demonstrate strong performance across a wide range of tasks.
  However, they often struggle to generalize beyond the distribution of their training
  data. In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of this limited generalization
  capability.  We identify shortcut learning—the reliance on task-irrelevant features—as
  a key impediment to generalization. Through comprehensive theoretical and empirical
  analysis, we uncover two primary contributors to shortcut learning: (1) limited
  diversity within individual sub-datasets, and (2) significant distributional disparities
  across sub-datasets, leading to dataset fragmentation. These issues arise from the
  inherent structure of large-scale datasets like OXE, which are typically composed
  of multiple sub-datasets collected independently across varied environments and
  embodiments. Our findings provide critical insights into dataset collection strategies
  that can reduce shortcut learning and enhance the generalization ability of generalist
  robot policies. Moreover, in scenarios where acquiring new large-scale data is impractical,
  we demonstrate that carefully selected robotic data augmentation strategies can
  effectively reduce shortcut learning in existing offline datasets, thereby improving
  generalization capabilities of generalist robot policies, e.g., $\pi_0$ in the SIMPLER
  Environment.'

title: 'Imagine, Verify, Execute: Memory-guided Agentic Exploration with Vision-Language
  Models'
section: Poster
openreview: 9AHjtHLlIe
abstract: Exploration is key for general-purpose robotic learning, particularly in
  open-ended environments where explicit guidance or task-specific feedback is limited.
  Vision-language models (VLMs), which can reason about object semantics, spatial
  relations, and potential outcomes, offer a promising foundation for guiding exploratory
  behavior by generating high-level goals or transitions. However, their outputs lack
  grounding, making it difficult to determine whether imagined transitions are physically
  feasible or informative. To bridge the gap between imagination and execution, we
  present IVE (Imagine, Verify, Execute), an agentic exploration framework inspired
  by human curiosity.  Human exploration often emerges from the drive to discover
  novel scene configurations and to understand the environment. Inspired by this,
  IVE leverages VLMs to abstract RGB-D observations into semantic scene graphs, imagine
  novel scenes, predict their physical plausibility, and generate executable skill
  sequences through action tools. We evaluate IVE in both simulated and real-world
  tabletop environments. The results show that IVE produces more diverse and meaningful
  exploration than RL baselines. The collected data facilitates learning downstream
  tasks that closely match those of policies trained on human-collected demonstrations.

title: Imitation Learning Based on Disentangled Representation Learning of Behavioral
  Characteristics
section: Poster
openreview: Af2RMaWRjm
abstract: 'In the field of robot learning, it is becoming possible to coordinate robot
  action through language instructions. On the other hand, it is still a difficult
  task to adjust the action based on human instructions because human instructions
  are often qualitative, and there are cases where there is no one-to-one correspondence
  between the behavior and the instructions. In this paper, we propose a motion generation
  model that can adjust actions in response to qualitative human instructions during
  task execution. The core of the proposed method is a learning architecture that
  maps qualitative human instructions to actions. Specifically, the demonstration
  is divided into short action sequences, and labels reflecting human qualitative
  senses are assigned to these sequences to realize learning that links human qualitative
  instructions and robot actions. In evaluation experiments, we verified the effectiveness
  of the method in two tasks: a pick-and-place task and a wiping task. Experimental
  results showed that the proposed method is able to generate motions in response
  to human qualitative instructions during task execution, whereas the conventional
  method generates trajectories all at once, making it impossible to adjust motions
  during task execution.'

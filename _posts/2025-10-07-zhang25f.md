title: 'AgentWorld: An Interactive Simulation Platform for Scene Construction and
  Mobile Robotic Manipulation'
section: Poster
openreview: XoRtWWjXuC
abstract: We introduce AgentWorld, an interactive simulation platform for developing
  household mobile manipulation capabilities. Our platform combines automated scene
  construction that encompasses layout generation, semantic asset placement, visual
  material configuration, and physics simulation, with a dual-mode teleoperation system
  supporting both wheeled bases and humanoid locomotion policies for data collection.
  The resulting AgentWorld Dataset captures diverse tasks ranging from primitive actions
  (pick-and-place, push-pull, etc.) to multistage activities (serve drinks, heat up
  food, etc.) across living rooms, bedrooms, and kitchens. Through extensive benchmarking
  of imitation learning methods including behavior cloning, action chunking transformers,
  diffusion policies, and vision-language-action models, we demonstrate the datasetâ€™s
  effectiveness for sim-to-real transfer. The integrated system provides a comprehensive
  solution for scalable robotic skill acquisition in complex home environments, bridging
  the gap between simulation-based training and real-world deployment.

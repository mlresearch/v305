title: NeuralSVCD for Efficient Swept Volume Collision Detection
section: Poster
openreview: 2xvxn3Hm3n
abstract: Robot manipulation in unstructured environments requires efficient and reliable
  Swept Volume Collision Detection (SVCD) for safe motion planning. Traditional discrete
  methods potentially miss collisions between these points, whereas SVCD continuously
  checks for collisions along the entire trajectory. Existing SVCD methods typically
  face a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, limiting practical use. In this
  paper, we introduce NeuralSVCD, a novel neural encoder-decoder architecture tailored
  to overcome this trade-off. Our approach leverages shape locality and temporal locality
  through distributed geometric representations and temporal optimization. This enhances
  computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Comprehensive experiments
  show that NeuralSVCD consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art SVCD methods
  in terms of both collision detection accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating
  its robust applicability across diverse robotic manipulation scenarios. Code and

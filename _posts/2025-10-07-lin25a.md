title: 'LocoTouch: Learning Dynamic Quadrupedal Transport with Tactile Sensing'
section: Poster
openreview: XaJkbK02Vm
abstract: 'Quadrupedal robots have demonstrated remarkable agility and robustness
  in traversing complex terrains. However, they struggle with dynamic object interactions,
  where contact must be precisely sensed and controlled. To bridge this gap, we present
  LocoTouch, a system that equips quadrupedal robots with tactile sensing to address
  a particularly challenging task in this category: long-distance transport of unsecured
  cylindrical objects, which typically requires custom mounting or fastening mechanisms
  to maintain stability. For efficient large-area tactile sensing, we design a high-density
  distributed tactile sensor that covers the entire back of the robot. To effectively
  leverage tactile feedback for robot control, we develop a simulation environment
  with high-fidelity tactile signals, and train tactile-aware transport policies using
  a two-stage learning pipeline. Furthermore, we design a novel reward function to
  promote robust, symmetric, and frequency-adaptive locomotion gaits. After training
  in simulation, LocoTouch transfers zero-shot to the real world, reliably transporting
  a wide range of unsecured cylindrical objects with diverse sizes, weights, and surface
  properties. Moreover, it remains robust over long distances, on uneven terrain,
  and under severe perturbations.'

  Action models'

abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a pivotal approach to learning
  robotic manipulation at scale by repurposing large pre-trained Vision-Language-Models
  (VLM) to output robotic actions. However, adapting VLMs for robotic domains comes
  with an unnecessarily high computational cost, which we attribute to the tokenization
  scheme of visual inputs. In this work, we aim to enable efficient VLA training by
  proposing Oat-VLA, an Object-Agent-centric Tokenization for VLAs. Building on the
  insights of object-centric representation learning, our method introduces an inductive
  bias towards scene objects and the agentâ€™s own visual information. As a result,
  we find that Oat-VLA can drastically reduce the number of visual tokens  to just
  a few tokens without sacrificing performance. We reveal that Oat-VLA converges at
  least twice as fast as OpenVLA on the LIBERO suite, as well as outperform OpenVLA
  in diverse real-world pick and place tasks.

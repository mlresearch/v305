section: Poster
openreview: LRG1xvtiwL
abstract: 'Learning bimanual manipulation is challenging due to its high dimensionality
  and tight coordination required between two arms. Eye-in-hand imitation learning,
  which uses wrist-mounted cameras, simplifies perception by focusing on task-relevant
  views. However, collecting diverse demonstrations remains costly, motivating the
  need for scalable data augmentation. While prior work has explored visual augmentation
  in single-arm settings, extending these approaches to bimanual manipulation requires
  generating viewpoint-consistent observations across both arms and producing corresponding
  action labels that are both valid and feasible. In this work, we propose Diffusion
  for COordinated Dual-arm Data Augmentation (D-CODA), a method for offline data augmentation
  tailored to eye-in-hand bimanual imitation learning that trains a diffusion model
  to synthesize novel, viewpoint-consistent wrist-camera images for both arms while
  simultaneously generating joint-space action labels. It employs constrained optimization
  to ensure that augmented states involving gripper-to-object contacts adhere to constraints
  suitable for bimanual coordination. We evaluate D-CODA on 5 simulated and 3 real-world
  tasks. Our results across 2250 simulation trials and 180 real-world trials demonstrate
  that it outperforms baselines and ablations, showing its potential for scalable
  data augmentation in eye-in-hand bimanual manipulation. Our anonymous website is

title: Non-conflicting Energy Minimization in Reinforcement Learning based Robot Control
section: Oral
openreview: kUA2ec94LI
abstract: Efficient robot locomotion often requires balancing task performance with
  energy expenditure. A common approach in reinforcement learning (RL) is to penalize
  energy use directly in the reward function. This requires carefully weighting the
  reward terms to avoid undesirable trade-offs where energy minimization harms task
  success or vice versa. In this work, we propose a hyperparameter-free gradient optimization
  method to minimize energy without conflicting with task performance. Inspired by
  recent works in multitask learning, our method applies policy gradient projection
  between task and energy objectives to promote non-conflicting updates. We evaluate
  this technique on standard locomotion benchmarks of DM-Control and HumanoidBench
  and demonstrate a reduction of $64$% energy usage while maintaining comparable task
  performance. Further, we conduct experiments on a Unitree GO2 quadruped showcasing
  Sim2Real transfer of energy efficient policies. Our method is easy to implement
  in standard RL pipelines with minimal code changes, and offers a principled alternative
  to reward shaping for energy efficient control policies.

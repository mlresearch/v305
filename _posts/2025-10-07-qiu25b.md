title: 'Articulate AnyMesh: Open-vocabulary 3D Articulated Objects Modeling'
section: Poster
openreview: BNCh3SS1Yl
abstract: 3D articulated objects modeling has long been a challenging problem, since
  it requires to capture both accurate surface geometries and semantically meaningful
  and spatially precise structures, parts, and joints. Existing methods heavily depend
  on training data from a limited set of handcrafted articulated object categories
  (e.g., cabinets and drawers), which restricts their ability to model a wide range
  of articulated objects in an open-vocabulary context. To address these limitations,
  we propose Articulate AnyMesh, an automated framework that is able to convert any
  rigid 3D mesh into its articulated counterpart in an open-vocabulary manner. Given
  a 3D mesh, our framework utilizes advanced Vision-Language Models and visual prompting
  techniques to extract semantic information, allowing for both the segmentation of
  object parts and the construction of functional joints. Our experiments show that
  Articulate AnyMesh can generate large-scale, high-quality 3D articulated objects,
  including tools, toys, mechanical devices, and vehicles, significantly expanding
  the coverage of existing 3D articulated object datasets. Additionally, we show that
  these generated assets can facilitate the acquisition of new articulated object
  manipulation skills in simulation, which can then be transferred to a real robotic
  system.

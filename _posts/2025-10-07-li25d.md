title: Morphologically Symmetric Reinforcement Learning for Ambidextrous Bimanual
  Manipulation
section: Poster
openreview: jZRz7Hvsyd
abstract: Humans naturally exhibit bilateral symmetry in their gross manipulation
  skills, effortlessly mirroring simple actions between left and right hands. Bimanual
  robots—which also feature bilateral symmetry—should similarly exploit this property
  to perform tasks with either hand. Unlike humans, who often favor a dominant hand
  for fine dexterous skills, robots should ideally execute ambidextrous manipulation
  with equal proficiency. To this end, we introduce SYMDEX (SYMmetric DEXterity),
  a reinforcement learning framework for ambidextrous bi-manipulation that leverages
  the robot’s inherent bilateral symmetry as an inductive bias. SYMDEX decomposes
  complex bimanual manipulation tasks into per-hand subtasks and trains dedicated
  policies for each. By exploiting bilateral symmetry via equivariant neural networks,
  experience from one arm is inherently leveraged by the opposite arm. We then distill
  the subtask policies into a global ambidextrous policy that is independent of the
  hand-task assignment. We evaluate SYMDEX on six challenging simulated manipulation
  tasks and demonstrate successful real-world deployment on two of them. Our approach
  outperforms baselines on more complex, asymmetric tasks, where the left and right
  hands perform different roles. We further demonstrate SYMDEX’s scalability by extending
  it to a four-arm manipulation setup, where our symmetry-aware policies enable effective
  multi-arm collaboration and coordination. Our results highlight how structural symmetry
  as inductive bias in policy learning enhances sample efficiency, robustness, and
  generalization across diverse dexterous manipulation tasks.

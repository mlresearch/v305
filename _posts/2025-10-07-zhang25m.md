title: Motion Blender Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic Reconstruction
section: Poster
openreview: 4Po2mqLjrQ
abstract: Gaussian splatting has emerged as a powerful tool for high-fidelity reconstruction
  of dynamic scenes.  However, existing methods primarily rely on implicit motion
  representations, such as encoding motions into neural networks or per-Gaussian parameters,
  which makes it difficult to further manipulate the reconstructed motions. This lack
  of explicit controllability limits existing methods to replaying recorded motions
  only, which hinders a wider application. To address this, we propose Motion Blender
  Gaussian Splatting (MB-GS), a novel framework that uses motion graph as an explicit
  and sparse motion representation. The motion of graph links is propagated to individual
  Gaussians via dual quaternion skinning, with learnable weight painting functions
  determining the influence of each link. The motion graphs and 3D Gaussians are jointly
  optimized from input videos via differentiable rendering. Experiments show that
  MB-GS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the iPhone dataset while being competitive
  on HyperNeRF. Additionally, we demonstrate the application potential of our method
  in animating novel object motions, synthesizing robot demonstrations through motion
  editing, and predicting robot actions through visual planning.

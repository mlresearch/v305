title: 'Lucid-XR: An Extended-Reality Data Engine for Robotic Manipulation'
section: Poster
openreview: 3p7rTnLJM8
abstract: We introduce Lucid-XR, a generative data engine for creating diverse and
  realistic-looking data to train real-world robot systems. At the core of Lucid-XR
  is vuer, a web-based physics simulation environment that runs directly on the XR
  headset, enabling internet-scale access to immersive, latency-free virtual interactions
  without requiring specialized equipment. The complete system integrates on-device
  physics simulation with on-device human-to-robot pose retargeting, that are further
  amplified by a physics-guided video generation pipeline commandable with natural
  language specifications. We demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of robot
  visual policies, trained entirely on Lucid-XR’s synthetic data, across bimanual
  and dexterous manipulation tasks that involve flexible materials, adhesive interaction
  between particles, and rigid body contact.

title: Few-Shot Neuro-Symbolic Imitation Learning for Long-Horizon Planning and Acting
section: Poster
openreview: bILubVwPoD
abstract: Imitation learning enables intelligent systems to acquire complex behaviors
  with minimal supervision. However, existing methods often focus on short-horizon
  skills, require large datasets, and struggle to solve long-horizon tasks or generalize
  across task variations and distribution shifts. We propose a novel neuro-symbolic
  framework that jointly learns continuous control policies and symbolic domain abstractions
  from a few skill demonstrations. Our method abstracts high-level task structures
  into a graph, discovers symbolic rules via an Answer Set Programming solver, and
  trains low-level controllers using diffusion policy imitation learning. A high-level
  oracle filters task-relevant information to focus each controller on a minimal observation
  and action space. Our graph-based neuro-symbolic framework enables capturing complex
  state transitions, including non-spatial and temporal relations, that data-driven
  learning or clustering techniques often fail to discover in limited demonstration
  datasets. We validate our approach in six domains that involve four robotic arms,
  Stacking, Kitchen, Assembly, and Towers of Hanoi environments, and a distinct Automated
  Forklift domain with two environments. The results demonstrate high data efficiency
  with as few as five skill demonstrations, strong zero- and few-shot generalizations,
  and interpretable decision making. Our code is publicly available.

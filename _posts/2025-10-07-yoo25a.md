title: 'KineSoft: Learning Proprioceptive Manipulation Policies with Soft Robot Hands'
section: Oral
openreview: PwKsCO6TAF
abstract: 'Underactuated soft robot hands offer inherent safety and adaptability advantages
  over rigid systems, but developing dexterous manipulation skills remains challenging.
  While imitation learning shows promise for complex manipulation tasks, traditional
  approaches struggle with soft systems due to demonstration collection challenges
  and ineffective state representations. We present KineSoft, a framework enabling
  direct kinesthetic teaching of soft robotic hands by leveraging their natural compliance
  as a skill teaching advantage rather than only as a control challenge. KineSoft
  makes two key contributions: (1) an internal strain sensing array providing occlusion-free
  proprioceptive shape estimation, and (2) a shape-based imitation learning framework
  that uses proprioceptive feedback with a low-level shape-conditioned controller
  to ground diffusion-based policies. This enables human demonstrators to physically
  guide the robot while the system learns to associate proprioceptive patterns with
  successful manipulation strategies. We validate KineSoft through physical experiments,
  demonstrating superior shape estimation accuracy compared to baseline methods, precise
  shape-trajectory tracking, and higher task success rates compared to baseline imitation
  learning approaches. KineSoftâ€™s results demonstrate that embracing the inherent
  properties of soft robots leads to intuitive and robust dexterous manipulation capabilities.'

title: Robot Operating Home Appliances by Reading User Manuals
section: Poster
openreview: wZUQq0JaL6
abstract: 'Operating home appliances, among the most common tools in every household,
  is a critical capability for assistive home robots. This paper presents ApBot, a
  robot system that operates novel household appliances by “reading” their user manuals.
  ApBot faces multiple challenges: (i) infer goal-conditioned partial policies from
  their unstructured, textual descriptions in a user manual document, (ii) ground
  the policies to the appliance in the physical world, and (iii) execute the policies
  reliably over potentially many steps, despite compounding errors. To tackle these
  challenges, ApBot constructs a structured, symbolic model of an appliance from its
  manual, with the help of a large vision-language model (VLM). It grounds the symbolic
  actions visually to control panel elements. Finally, ApBot closes the loop by updating
  the model based on visual feedback. Our experiments show that across a wide range
  of simulated and real-world appliances, ApBot achieves consistent and statistically
  significant improvements in task success rate, compared with state-of-the-art large
  VLMs used directly as control policies. These results suggest that a structured
  internal representations plays an important role in robust robot operation of home
  appliances, especially, complex ones.'

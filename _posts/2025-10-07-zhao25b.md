title: 'AnyPlace: Learning Generalizable Object Placement for Robot Manipulation'
section: Poster
openreview: H0zFqW6QM0
abstract: 'Object placement in robotic tasks is inherently challenging due to the
  diversity of object geometries and placement configurations. We address this with
  AnyPlace, a two-stage method trained entirely on synthetic data, capable of predicting
  a wide range of feasible placement poses for real-world tasks. Our key insight is
  that by leveraging a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to identify approximate placement
  locations, we can focus only on the relevant regions for precise local placement,
  which enables us to train the low-level placement-pose-prediction model to capture
  multimodal placements efficiently. For training, we generate a fully synthetic dataset
  comprising 13 categories of randomly generated objects in 5370 different placement
  poses across three configurations (insertion, stacking, hanging) and train local
  placement-prediction models. We extensively evaluate our method in high-fidelity
  simulation and show that it consistently outperforms baseline approaches across
  all three tasks in terms of success rate, coverage of placement modes, and precision.
  In real-world experiments, our method achieves an average success and coverage rate
  of 76% across three tasks, where most baseline methods fail completely. We further
  validate the generalization of our approach on 16 real-world placement tasks, demonstrating
  that models trained purely on synthetic data can be directly transferred to the
  real world in a zero-shot setting. More at: https://anyplace-pnp.github.io.'

title: 'RoboChemist: Long-Horizon and Safety-Compliant Robotic Chemical Experimentation'
section: Poster
openreview: LbeMepi89R
abstract: Robotic chemists promise to both liberate human experts from repetitive
  tasks and accelerate scientific discovery, yet remain in their infancy. Chemical
  experiments involve long-horizon procedures over hazardous and deformable substances,
  where success requires not only task completion but also strict compliance with
  experimental norms. To address these challenges, we propose RoboChemist, a dual-loop
  framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Vision-Language-Action
  (VLA) models. Unlike prior VLM-based systems (e.g., VoxPoser, ReKep) that rely on
  depth perception and struggle with transparent labware, and existing VLA systems
  (e.g., RDT, $\pi_0$) that lack semantic-level feedback for complex tasks, our method
  leverages a VLM to serve as (1) a planner to decompose tasks into primitive actions,
  (2) a visual prompt generator to guide VLA models, and (3) a monitor to assess task
  success and regulatory compliance. Notably, we introduce a VLA interface that accepts
  image-based visual targets from the VLM, enabling precise, goal-conditioned control.
  Our system successfully executes both primitive actions and complete multi-step
  chemistry protocols. Results show significant improvements in both success rate
  and compliance rate over state-of-the-art VLM and VLA baselines, while also demonstrating
  strong generalization to objects and tasks. Code, data, and models will be released.

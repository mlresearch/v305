title: 'MirrorDuo: Reflection-Consistent Visuomotor Learning from Mirrored Demonstration
  Pairs'
section: Poster
openreview: cUeY476ohd
abstract: Image-based behaviour cloning leverages demonstrations captured from ubiquitous
  RGB cameras, enabling impressive visuomotor performance. However, it remains constrained
  by the cost of collecting sufficiently diverse demonstrations, especially for generalizing
  across workspace variations. We propose MirrorDuo, a mirroring-based formulation
  that operates on image, proprioception, and full 6-DoF end-effector action tuples,
  generating a mirrored counterpart for each original demonstration, effectively achieving
  â€œcollect one, get one for free." It can be applied as a data augmentation strategy
  for existing learning pipelines, such as standard behaviour cloning or diffusion
  policy, or as a structural prior for reflection-equivariant policy networks. By
  leveraging the overlap between the original and mirrored domains, MirrorDuo achieves
  significantly improved performance under the same data budget when demonstrations
  are evenly distributed across both sides of the workspace. When demonstrations are
  confined to one side, MirrorDuo enables efficient skill transfer to the mirrored
  workspace with as few as zero or just 5 demonstrations in the target arrangement.

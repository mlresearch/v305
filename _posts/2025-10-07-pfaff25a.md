title: Steerable Scene Generation with Post Training and Inference-Time Search
section: Poster
openreview: oOCa85Z1Ho
abstract: Training robots in simulation requires diverse 3D scenes that reflect the
  specific challenges of downstream tasks. However, scenes that satisfy strict task
  requirements, such as high-clutter environments with plausible spatial arrangement,
  are rare and costly to curate manually. Instead, we generate large-scale scene data
  using procedural models that approximate realistic environments for robotic manipulation,
  and adapt it to task-specific goals. We do this by training a unified diffusion-based
  generative model that predicts which objects to place from a fixed asset library,
  along with their SE(3) poses. This model serves as a flexible scene prior that can
  be adapted using reinforcement learning-based post training, conditional generation,
  or inference-time search, steering generation toward downstream objectives even
  when they differ from the original data distribution. Our method enables goal-directed
  scene synthesis that respects physical feasibility and scales across scene types.
  We introduce a novel MCTS-based inference-time search strategy for diffusion models,
  enforce feasibility via projection and simulation, and release a dataset of over
  44 million SE(3) scenes spanning five diverse environments.

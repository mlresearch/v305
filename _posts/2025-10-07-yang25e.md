title: 'FOMO-3D: Using Vision Foundation Models for Long-Tailed 3D Object Detection'
section: Poster
openreview: 19LSN4QnV4
abstract: In order to navigate complex traffic environments, self-driving vehicles
  must recognize many semantic classes pertaining to vulnerable road users or traffic
  control devices.  However, many safety-critical objects (e.g., construction worker)
  appear infrequently in nominal traffic conditions, leading to a severe shortage
  of training examples from driving data alone.  Recent vision foundation models,
  which are trained on a large corpus of data, can serve as a good source of external
  prior knowledge to improve generalization. We propose FOMO-3D, the first 3D detector
  to leverage vision foundation models for long-tailed 3D detection. Specifically,
  FOMO-3D exploits rich semantic and depth priors from OWLv2 and Metric3Dv2 within
  a two-stage detection paradigm that first generates proposals with a LiDAR-based
  branch and a novel camera-based branch, and refines them with attention especially
  to image features from OWL. Evaluations on real-world driving data show that using
  rich priors from vision foundation models with careful multimodal fusion designs
  leads to large gains for long-tailed 3D detection.

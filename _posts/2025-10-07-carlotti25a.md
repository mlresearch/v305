title: Self-supervised Learning Of Visual Pose Estimation Without Pose Labels By Classifying
  LED States
section: Poster
openreview: OXHF0BvmRT
abstract: 'We introduce a model for monocular RGB relative pose estimation of a ground
  robot that trains from scratch without pose labels nor prior knowledge about the
  robotâ€™s shape or appearance. At training time, we assume: (i) a robot fitted with
  multiple LEDs, whose states are independent and known at each frame; (ii) knowledge
  of the approximate viewing direction of each LED; and (iii) availability of a calibration
  image with a known target distance, to address the ambiguity of monocular depth
  estimation. Training data is collected by a pair of robots moving randomly without
  needing external infrastructure or human supervision. Our model trains on the task
  of predicting from an image the state of each LED on the robot. In doing so, it
  learns to predict the position of the robot in the image, its distance, and its
  relative bearing. At inference time, the state of the LEDs is unknown, can be arbitrary,
  and does not affect the pose estimation performance. Quantitative experiments indicate
  that our approach: is competitive with SoA approaches that require supervision from
  pose labels or a CAD model of the robot; generalizes to different domains; and handles
  multi-robot pose estimation.'

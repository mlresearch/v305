title: 'UnPose: Uncertainty-Guided Diffusion Priors for Zero-Shot Pose Estimation'
section: Poster
openreview: L5PJBd8ahD
abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of novel objects is a fundamental yet challenging
  problem in robotics, often relying on access to object CAD models.  However, acquiring
  such models can be costly and impractical.  Recent approaches aim to bypass this
  requirement by leveraging strong priors from foundation models to reconstruct objects
  from single or multi-view images, but typically require additional training or produce
  hallucinated geometry. To this end, we propose $\textit{UnPose}$, a novel framework
  for zero-shot, model-free 6D object pose estimation and reconstruction that exploits
  3D priors and uncertainty estimates from a pre-trained diffusion model.  Specifically,
  starting from a single-view RGB-D frame, $\textit{UnPose}$ uses a multi-view diffusion
  model to estimate an initial 3D model using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation,
  along with pixel-wise epistemic uncertainty estimates. As additional observations
  become available, we incrementally refine the 3DGS model by fusing new views guided
  by the diffusion modelâ€™s uncertainty, thereby, continuously improving the pose estimation
  accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality.  To ensure global consistency, the diffusion
  prior-generated views and subsequent observations are further integrated in a pose
  graph and jointly optimized into a coherent 3DGS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate
  that $\textit{UnPose}$ significantly outperforms existing approaches in both 6D
  pose estimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. We further showcase its
  practical applicability in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

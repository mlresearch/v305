title: Diffusion-Guided Multi-Arm Motion Planning
section: Poster
openreview: AO0BKxf3ss
abstract: Multi-arm motion planning is fundamental for enabling arms to complete collaborative
  tasks in shared spaces but current methods struggle with scalability due to exponential
  state-space growth and reliance on large training datasets for learned models. Inspired
  by Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), which decomposes planning into single-agent
  problems coupled with collision resolution, we propose a novel diffusion-guided
  multi-arm planner (DG-MAP) that enhances scalability of learning-based models while
  reducing their reliance on massive multi-arm datasets. Recognizing that collisions
  are primarily pairwise, we train two conditional diffusion models, one to generate
  feasible single-arm trajectories, and a second, to model the dual-arm dynamics required
  for effective pairwise collision resolution. By integrating these specialized generative
  models within a MAPF-inspired structured decomposition, our planner efficiently
  scales to larger number of arms. Evaluations against alternative learning-based
  methods across various team sizes demonstrate our methodâ€™s effectiveness and practical
  applicability. Code and data will be made publicly available. View video demonstrations
  in our supplementary material.

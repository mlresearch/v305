abstract: Synthesizing diverse, uncertainty-aware grasps for multi-fingered hands
  from partial observations remains a critical challenge in robot learning. Prior
  generative methods struggle to model the intricate grasp distribution of dexterous
  hands and often fail to reason about shape uncertainty inherent in partial point
  clouds, leading to unreliable or overly conservative grasps. We propose FFHFlow,
  a flow-based variational framework that generates diverse, robust multi-finger grasps
  while explicitly quantifying perceptual uncertainty in the partial point clouds.
  Our approach leverages a normalizing flow-based deep latent variable model to learn
  a hierarchical grasp manifold, overcoming the mode collapse and rigid prior limitations
  of conditional Variational Autoencoders (cVAEs). By exploiting the invertibility
  and exact likelihoods of flows, FFHFlow introspects shape uncertainty in partial
  observations and identifies novel object structures, enabling risk-aware grasp synthesis.
  To further enhance reliability, we integrate a discriminative grasp evaluator with
  the flow likelihoods, formulating an uncertainty-aware ranking strategy that prioritizes
  grasps robust to shape ambiguity. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world
  setups demonstrate that FFHFlow outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (including
  diffusion models) in grasp diversity and success rate, while achieving run-time
  efficient sampling. We also showcase its practical value in cluttered and confined
  environments, where diversity-driven sampling excels by mitigating collisions.

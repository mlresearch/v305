title: 'ATK: Automatic Task-driven Keypoint Selection for Robust Policy Learning'
section: Poster
openreview: a5LFUOlkIj
abstract: Learning visuamotor policy through imitation learning often suffers from
  perceptual challenges, where visual differences between training and evaluation
  environments degrade policy performance. Policies relying on state estimations like
  6D pose, require task-specific tracking and are difficult to scale, while raw sensor-based
  policies may lack robustness to small visual disturbances. In this work, we leverage
  2D keypoints — spatially consistent features in the image frame — as a state representation
  for robust policy learning, and apply it to both sim-to-real transfer and real-world
  imitation learning. However, the choice of which keypoints to use can vary across
  objects and tasks. We propose a novel method -ATK, to automatically select keypoints
  in a task-driven manner, such that the chosen keypoints are  that are predictive
  of optimal behavior for the given task. Our proposal optimizes for a minimal set
  of task-relevant keypoints that preserve policy performance and robustness. We distill
  expert data (either from an expert policy in simulation or a human expert) into
  a policy that operates on RGB images while tracking the selected keypoints. By leveraging
  pre-trained visual modules, our system effectively tracks keypoints and transfers
  policies to the real-world evaluation scenario, even given perceptual challenges
  like transparent objects or fine-grained manipulation, or widely varying scene appearance.
  We validate our approach on various robotic tasks, demonstrating that these minimal
  keypoint representations improve robustness to visual disturbances and environmental
  variations.

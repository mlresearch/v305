title: 'FACET: Force-Adaptive Control via Impedance Reference Tracking for Legged
  Robots'
section: Oral
openreview: EcOGafgvuC
abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has made significant strides in legged robot
  control, enabling locomotion across diverse terrains and complex loco-manipulation
  capabilities. However, the commonly used position or velocity tracking-based objectives
  are agnostic to forces experienced by the robot, leading to stiff and potentially
  dangerous behaviors and poor control during forceful interactions. To address this
  limitation, we present Force-Adaptive Control via Impedance Reference Tracking (FACET).
  Inspired by impedance control, we use RL to train a control policy to imitate a
  virtual mass-spring-damper system, allowing fine-grained control under external
  forces by manipulating the virtual spring.  In simulation, we demonstrate that our
  quadruped robot achieves improved robustness to large impulses (up to 200 Ns) and
  exhibits controllable compliance, achieving an 80% reduction in collision impulse.
  The policy is deployed to a physical robot, demonstrating both compliant behavior,
  such as initiation/cessation of movement with finger tip, and the ability to pull
  payloads up to 10kg. Further extension to a legged loco-manipulator and a humanoid
  shows the applicability of our method to more complex settings to enable whole-body
  compliance control.

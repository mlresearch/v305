title: 'FastUMI: A Scalable and Hardware-Independent Universal Manipulation Interface
  with Dataset'
section: Poster
openreview: RUSscFSEfD
abstract: 'Real-world manipulation datasets for robotic arms remain scarce due to
  the high costs, rigid hardware dependencies, and complex setup procedures associated
  with existing data collection methods. We introduce, a redesigned Universal Manipulation
  Interface (UMI) that addresses these challenges, enabling low-cost, scalable, and
  rapid deployment across heterogeneous platforms. FastUMI achieves this through:
  (i) hardware decoupling via extensive mechanical reengineering, which removes dependence
  on specialized robotic components while preserving a consistent visual perspective;
  (ii) replacement of complex visualâ€“inertial odometry with a commercial off-the-shelf
  tracker, simplifying the software stack without compromising pose estimation accuracy;
  and (iii) the provision of an integrated ecosystem that streamlines data acquisition,
  automates quality control, and ensures compatibility with both standard and enhanced
  imitation-learning pipelines. To facilitate further research, we release an open-access
  dataset comprising over 15,000 real-world demonstrations spanning 24 tasks constituting
  one of the most extensive UMI-like resources to date. Empirical evaluations show
  that FastUMI supports rapid deployment, reduces operational overhead, and delivers
  robust performance across diverse manipulation scenarios, advancing scalable data-driven
  robotic learning.'

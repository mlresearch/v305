title: 'FetchBot: Learning Generalizable Object Fetching in Cluttered Scenes via Zero-Shot
  Sim2Real'
section: Oral
openreview: 5ySSVlJBOn
abstract: Generalizable object fetching in cluttered scenes remains a fundamental
  and application-critical challenge in embodied AI. Closely packed objects cause
  inevitable occlusions, making safe action generation particularly difficult. Under
  such partial observability, effective policies must not only generalize across diverse
  objects and layouts but also reason about occlusion to avoid collisions. However,
  collecting large-scale real-world data for this task remains prohibitively expensive,
  leaving this problem largely unsolved. In this paper, we introduce FetchBot, a sim-to-real
  framework for this challenge. We first curate a large-scale synthetic dataset featuring
  1M diverse scenes and 500k representative demonstrations. Based on this dataset,
  FetchBot employs a depth-conditioned method for action generation, which leverages
  structural cues to enable robust obstacle-aware action planning. However, depth
  is perfect in simulation but noisy in real-world environments. To address this sim-to-real
  gap, FetchBot predicts depth from RGB inputs using a foundation model and integrates
  local occupancy prediction as a co-training task, providing a generalizable latent
  representation for sim-to-real transfer. Extensive experiments in simulation and
  real-world environments demonstrate FetchBotâ€™s strong zero-shot sim-to-real transfer,
  effective clutter handling, and adaptability to novel scenarios. In cluttered environments,
  it achieves an average success rate of 89.95%, significantly outperforming prior
  methods. Moreover, FetchBot demonstrates excellent robustness in challenging cases,
  such as fetching transparent, reflective, and irregular objects, highlighting its
  practical value.

title: 'KoopMotion: Learning Almost Divergence Free Koopman Flow Fields for Motion
  Planning'
section: Poster
openreview: hg9YtHV8MJ
abstract: In this work, we propose a novel flow field-based motion planning method
  that drives a robot from any initial state to a desired reference trajectory such
  that it converges to the trajectoryâ€™s end point.  Despite demonstrated efficacy
  in using Koopman operator theory for modeling dynamical systems, Koopman does not
  inherently enforce convergence to desired trajectories nor to specified goals, a
  requirement when learning from demonstrations (LfD).  We present KoopMotion which
  represents motion flow fields as dynamical systems, parameterized by Koopman Operators,
  and leverages the divergence properties of the learnt flow fields to obtain smooth
  motion fields that converge to a desired reference trajectory when the robot is
  placed away from the desired trajectory, and tracks the trajectory until the end
  point. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show evaluations of
  KoopMotion on the LASA human handwriting dataset, including spectral analysis. We
  also perform experiments on a physical robot, verifying KoopMotion on a miniature
  autonomous surface vehicle operating in a non-static fluid flow environment. Our
  approach is highly sample efficient in both space and time, requiring only 3% of
  the LASA dataset to generate dense motion plans. Additionally, KoopMotion provides
  a significant improvement over baselines when comparing metrics that measure spatial
  and temporal dynamics modeling efficacy.

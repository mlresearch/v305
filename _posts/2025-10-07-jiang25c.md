title: 'IRIS: An Immersive Robot Interaction System'
section: Poster
openreview: b2mXmmGX8E
abstract: This paper introduces IRIS, an Immersive Robot Interaction System leveraging
  Extended Reality (XR). Existing XR-based systems enable efficient data collection
  but are often challenging to reproduce and reuse due to their specificity to particular
  robots, objects, simulators, and environments. IRIS addresses these issues by supporting
  immersive interaction and data collection across diverse simulators and real-world
  scenarios. It visualizes arbitrary rigid and deformable objects, robots from simulation,
  and integrates real-time sensor-generated point clouds for real-world applications.
  Additionally, IRIS enhances collaborative capabilities by enabling multiple users
  to simultaneously interact within the same virtual scene. Extensive experiments
  demonstrate that IRIS offers efficient and intuitive data collection in both simulated
  and real-world settings.

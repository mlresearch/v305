section: Poster
openreview: HqqyJ9A2fy
abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of modern robots remains challenging due
  to their high degrees of freedom and intricate mechanisms. Neural simulators have
  emerged as a promising alternative to traditional analytical simulators, capable
  of efficiently predicting complex dynamics and adapting to real-world data; however,
  existing neural simulators typically require application-specific training and fail
  to generalize to novel tasks and/or environments, primarily due to inadequate representations
  of the global state. In this work, we address the problem of learning generalizable
  neural simulators for robots that are structured as articulated rigid bodies. We
  propose *NeRD* (Neural Robot Dynamics), learned robot-specific dynamics models for
  predicting future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact constraints.
  *NeRD* uniquely replaces the low-level dynamics and contact solvers in an analytical
  simulator and employs a robot-centric and spatially-invariant simulation state representation.
  We integrate the learned *NeRD* models as an interchangeable backend solver within
  a state-of-the-art robotics simulator. We conduct extensive experiments to show
  that the *NeRD* simulators are stable and accurate over a thousand simulation steps;
  generalize across tasks and environment configurations; enable policy learning exclusively
  in a neural engine; and, unlike most classical simulators, can be fine-tuned from
  real-world data to bridge the gap between simulation and reality.

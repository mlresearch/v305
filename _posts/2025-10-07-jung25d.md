title: Joint Model-based Model-free Diffusion for Planning with Constraints
section: Poster
openreview: E9t1ekt6W9
abstract: 'Model-free diffusion planners have shown great promise for robot motion
  planning, but practical robotic systems often require combining them with model-based
  optimization modules to enforce constraints, such as safety. Naïvely integrating
  these modules presents compatibility challenges when diffusion’s multi-modal outputs
  behave adversarially to optimization-based modules. To address this, we introduce
  Joint Model-based Model-free Diffusion (JM2D), a novel generative modeling framework.
  JM2D formulates module integration as a joint sampling problem to maximize compatibility
  via an interaction potential, without additional training. Using importance sampling,
  JM2D guides modules outputs based only on evaluations of the interaction potential,
  thus handling non-differentiable objectives commonly arising from non-convex optimization
  modules. We evaluate JM2D via application to aligning diffusion planners with safety
  modules on offline RL and robot manipulation. JM2D significantly improves task performance
  compared to conventional safety filters without sacrificing safety. Further, we
  show that conditional generation is a special case of JM2D and elucidate key design
  choices by comparing with SOTA gradient-based and projection-based diffusion planners.

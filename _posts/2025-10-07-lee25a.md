title: 'CLASS: Contrastive Learning via Action Sequence Supervision for Robot Manipulation'
section: Poster
openreview: 9f3klkpa4y
abstract: Recent advances in Behavior Cloning (BC) have led to strong performance
  in robotic manipulation, driven by expressive models, sequence modeling of actions,
  and large-scale demonstration data. However, BC faces significant challenges when
  applied to heterogeneous datasets, such as visual shift with different camera poses
  or object appearances, where performance degrades despite the benefits of learning
  at scale. This stems from BCâ€™s tendency to overfit individual demonstrations rather
  than capture shared structure, limiting generalization. To address this, we introduce
  Contrastive Learning via Action Sequence Supervision (CLASS), a method for learning
  behavioral representations from demonstrations using supervised contrastive learning.
  CLASS leverages weak supervision from similar action sequences identified via Dynamic
  Time Warping (DTW) and optimizes a soft InfoNCE loss with similarity-weighted positive
  pairs. We evaluate CLASS on 5 simulation benchmarks and 3 real-world tasks to achieve
  competitive results using retrieval-based control with representations only. Most
  notably, for downstream policy learning under significant visual shifts, CLASS achieves
  an average success rate of 70% with Diffusion Policy, while all other baseline methods
  fail to perform competitively.

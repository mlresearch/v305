title: Rapid Mismatch Estimation via Neural Network Informed Variational Inference
section: Poster
openreview: 2CIKnIwSta
abstract: With robots increasingly operating in human-centric environments, ensuring
  soft and safe physical interactions, whether with humans, surroundings, or other
  machines, is essential. While compliant hardware can facilitate such interactions,
  this work focuses on impedance controllers that allow torque-controlled robots to
  safely and passively respond to contact while accurately executing tasks. From inverse
  dynamics to quadratic programming based controllers, the effectiveness of these
  methods relies on accurate dynamics models of the robot and the object it manipulates.
  Any model mismatch results in task failures and unsafe behaviors. Thus, we introduce
  Rapid Mismatch Estimation (RME), an adaptive, controller-agnostic, probabilistic
  framework that estimates end-effector dynamics mismatches online, without relying
  on external force-torque sensors. From the robot’s proprioceptive feedback, a Neural
  Network Model Mismatch Estimator generates a prior for a Variational Inference solver,
  which rapidly converges to the unknown parameters while quantifying uncertainty.
  With a real 7-DoF manipulator driven by a state-of-the-art passive impedance controller,
  RME adapts to sudden changes in mass and center of mass at the end-effector in $\sim400$
  ms, in static and dynamic settings. We demonstrate RME in a collaborative scenario
  where a human attaches an unknown basket to the robot’s end-effector and dynamically
  adds/removes heavy items, showcasing fast and safe adaptation to changing dynamics
  during physical interaction without any external sensory system.

title: Meta-Optimization and Program Search using Language Models for Task and Motion
  Planning
section: Poster
openreview: 1n1Liq6So4
abstract: 'Intelligent interaction with the real world requires robotic agents to
  jointly reason over high-level plans and low-level controls. This requirement is
  formalized in the task and motion planning (TAMP) problem, in which symbolic planning
  and continuous trajectory generation must be solved in a coordinated manner. Recently,
  foundation model-based approaches to TAMP have presented impressive results, including
  fast planning times and the execution of natural language instructions. Yet, the
  optimal interface between high-level plan and low-level motion generation remains
  to be found: prior approaches are limited by either too much abstraction (e.g.,
  chaining simplified skill primitives) or a lack thereof (e.g., direct joint angle
  prediction). Our method introduces a novel technique employing a form of meta-optimization
  to address these shortcomings by: (i) using program search over trajectory optimization
  problems as an interface between foundation model and robot controllers, and (ii)
  leveraging a zero-order method to optimize numerical values in the foundation model
  output. Results on challenging object manipulation and drawing tasks confirm that
  our proposed method improves over prior TAMP approaches.'

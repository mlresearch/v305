title: 'Long Range Navigator (LRN): Extending robot planning horizons beyond metric
  maps'
section: Poster
openreview: QtVZUPCKrY
abstract: A robot navigating an outdoor environment with no prior knowledge of the
  space must rely on its local sensing, which is in the form of a local metric map
  or local policy with some fixed horizon. A limited planning horizon can often result
  in myopic decisions leading the robot off course or worse, into very difficult terrain.
  In this work, we make a key observation that long range navigation only necessitates
  identifying good frontier directions for planning instead of full map knowledge.
  To address this, we introduce Long Range Navigator (LRN), which learns to predict
  affordableâ€™ frontier directions from high-dimensional camera images. LRN is trained
  entirely on unlabeled egocentric videos, making it scalable and adaptable. In off-road
  tests on Spot and a large vehicle, LRN reduces human interventions and improves
  decision speed when integrated into existing navigation stacks.

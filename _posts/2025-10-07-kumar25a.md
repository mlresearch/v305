title: 'COLLAGE: Adaptive Fusion-based Retrieval for Augmented Policy Learning'
section: Poster
openreview: B6knAJsB9P
abstract: 'In this work, we study the problem of data retrieval for few-shot imitation
  learning: select data from a large dataset to train a performant policy for a specific
  task, given only a few target demonstrations. Prior methods retrieve data using
  a single-feature distance heuristic, assuming that the best demonstrations are those
  that most closely resemble the target examples in visual, semantic, or motion space.
  However, this approach captures only a subset of the relevant information and is
  prone to introducing detrimental demonstrations, e.g., retrieving data from unrelated
  tasks due to similar scene layouts, or selecting similar motions from tasks with
  divergent goals. We present COLLAGE, a method for COLLective data AGgrEgation in
  few-shot imitation learning that uses an adaptive late fusion mechanism to guide
  the selection of relevant demonstrations based on a task12 specific combination
  of multiple cues. COLLAGE follows a simple, but flexible and efficient data aggregation
  recipe: it assigns weights to subsets of the dataset that are pre-selected using
  a single feature (e.g., appearance, shape, or language similarity), based on their
  task relevance, measured by how well a policy trained on each subset predicts actions
  in the few target demonstrations. These weights are then used during policy training
  to perform importance sampling over the aggregated dataset, sampling data more densely
  or sparsely, according to their estimated relevance. This weighted aggregation strategy
  is general and feature-agnostic, allowing COLLAGE to combine and leverage any number
  of subsets selected by any retrieval heuristic or method, and to identify which
  subset provides the most benefit for the target task. In extensive experiments,
  COLLAGE outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval and multi-task learning approaches,
  achieving a 5.1% improvement over the best baseline in simulation across 10 tasks,
  and a 16.6% improvement in the real world across 6 tasks. For our real world experiments,
  we include data selection from the large-scale, real-world DROID dataset, significantly
  improving few-shot imitation policy training. More information at: https://collagecorl25.github.io/'

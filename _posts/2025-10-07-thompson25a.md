title: 'Agreement Volatility: A Second-Order Metric for Uncertainty Quantification
  in Surgical Robot Learning'
section: Poster
openreview: K7KLc4FexO
abstract: Autonomous surgical robots are a promising solution to the increasing demand
  for surgery amid a shortage of surgeons. Recent work has proposed learning-based
  approaches for the autonomous manipulation of soft tissue. However, due to variability
  in aspects such as tissue geometries and stiffnesses, these methods do not always
  perform well, especially in out-of-distribution settings. To address this challenge,
  we propose a novel second-order metric for uncertainty quantification, agreement
  volatility, that enables successful and efficient collaborative handoffs between
  a human operator and a robot during soft-tissue manipulation by allowing the robot
  to know when to cede control to human operators and when to resume autonomous operation.
  We validate our approach using the daVinci Research Kit (dVRK) surgical robot to
  perform risk-aware physical soft-tissue manipulation. Our experimental results demonstrate
  that our proposed agreement volatility metric improves system success rates and
  leads to a 10% lower reliance on human interventions compared to a variance-only
  baseline.  We further demonstrate the usefulness of our agreement volatility metric
  as a spatial uncertainty map over geometric point cloud data, enabling uncertainty
  attribution which provides insight into regions of the input causing uncertainty.

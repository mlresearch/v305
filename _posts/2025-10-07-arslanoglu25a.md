title: 'Pointing3D: A Benchmark for 3D Object Referral via Pointing Gestures'
section: Poster
openreview: h2K52fhsDU
abstract: Pointing gestures provide a natural and efficient way to communicate spatial
  information in human-machine interaction, yet their potential for 3D object referral
  remains largely under-explored. To fill this gap, we introduce the task of pointing-based
  3D segmentation. In this task, given an image of a person pointing at an object
  and the 3D point cloud of the environment, the goal is to predict the 3D segmentation
  mask of the referred object. To enable the standardized evaluation of this task,
  we introduce POINTR3D, a curated dataset of over 65,000 frames captured with three
  cameras across four indoor scenes, featuring diverse pointing scenarios. Each frame
  is annotated with the information of the active hand, the corresponding object ID,
  and the 3D segmentation mask of the object. To showcase the application of the proposed
  dataset, we further introduce Pointing3D, a transformer-based architecture that
  predicts the pointing direction from RGB images and uses this prediction as a prompt
  to segment the referred object in the 3D point cloud. Experimental results show
  that Pointing3D outperforms other strong baselines we introduce and lays the groundwork
  for future research. The dataset, source code, and evaluation tools will be made
  publicly available to support further research in this area, enabling a natural
  human-machine interaction.

title: Generating Robot Constitutions & Benchmarks for Semantic Safety
section: Poster
openreview: 9HwVDqndnv
abstract: Large vision and language models are being increasingly deployed on real
  robots, leading to an immediate need for ensuring robot safety under AI-control.
  In this paper, we develop the ASIMOV Benchmark — a collection of large-scale semantic
  safety datasets grounded in real-world visual scenes and human injury reports from
  hospitals (500k situations, 3M instructions). We propose a scalable recipe for data
  generation leveraging text and image generation techniques to synthesize safety-relevant
  scenarios. As a second contribution, we develop a framework to automatically generate
  robot constitutions from real-world data to steer a robot’s behavior using Constitutional
  AI mechanisms. We report a top alignment rate of 84.3% on the ASIMOV Benchmark using
  generated constitutions, outperforming no-constitution baselines and human-written
  constitutions. We argue that human interpretability and modifiability of constitutions
  inferred from data make them an ideal medium for behavior governance of AI-controlled
  robots.

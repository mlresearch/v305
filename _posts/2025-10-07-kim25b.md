title: 'BranchOut: Capturing Realistic Multimodality in Autonomous Driving Decisions'
section: Poster
openreview: jedBaI1fgU
abstract: Modeling the nuanced, multimodal nature of human driving remains a core
  challenge for autonomous systems, as existing methods often fail to capture the
  diversity of plausible behaviors in complex real-world scenarios. In this work,
  we introduce a novel benchmark and end-to-end planner for modeling realistic multimodality
  in autonomous driving decisions.  We propose a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based
  diffusion model designed to explicitly capture human-like, multimodal driving decisions
  in diverse contexts. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on current
  benchmarks, but reveals weaknesses in standard evaluation practices, which rely
  on single ground-truth trajectories or coarse closed-loop metrics while often penalizing
  diverse yet plausible alternatives. To address this limitation, we further develop
  a human-in-the-loop simulation benchmark that enables finer-grained evaluations
  and measures multimodal realism in challenging driving settings. Our code, models,
  and benchmark data will be released to promote more accurate and human-aware evaluation
  of autonomous driving models.

title: Merging and Disentangling Views in Visual Reinforcement Learning for Robotic
  Manipulation
section: Poster
openreview: zK2SK6WbYn
abstract: Vision is well-known for its use in manipulation, especially using visual
  servoing. To make it robust, multiple cameras are needed to expand the field of
  view. That is computationally challenging. Merging multiple views and using Q-learning
  allows the design of more effective representations and optimization of sample efficiency.
  Such a solution might be expensive to deploy. To mitigate this, we introduce a merge
  and disentanglement (MAD) algorithm that efficiently merges views to increase sample
  efficiency while augmenting with single-view features to allow lightweight deployment
  and ensure robust policies. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our
  approach using Meta-World and ManiSkill3.

title: Decentralized Aerial Manipulation of a Cable-Suspended Load Using Multi-Agent
  Reinforcement Learning
section: Poster
openreview: IuiB5iaMxy
abstract: 'This paper presents the first decentralized method to enable real-world
  6-DoF manipulation of a cable-suspended load using a team of Micro-Aerial Vehicles
  (MAVs). Our method leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to train
  an outer-loop control policy for each MAV. Unlike state-of-the-art controllers that
  utilize a centralized scheme, our policy does not require global states, inter-MAV
  communications, nor neighboring MAV information. Instead, agents communicate implicitly
  through load pose observations alone, which enables high scalability and flexibility.
  It also significantly reduces computing costs during inference time, enabling onboard
  deployment of the policy. In addition, we introduce a new action space design for
  the MAVs using linear acceleration and body rates. This choice, combined with a
  robust low-level controller, enables reliable sim-to-real transfer despite significant
  uncertainties caused by cable tension during dynamic 3D motion. We validate our
  method in various real-world experiments, including full-pose control under load
  model uncertainties, showing setpoint tracking performance comparable to the state-of-the-art
  centralized method. We also demonstrate cooperation amongst agents with heterogeneous
  control policies, and robustness to the complete in-flight loss of one MAV. Videos

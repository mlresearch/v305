title: 'CDP: Towards Robust Autoregressive Visuomotor Policy Learning via Causal Diffusion'
section: Poster
openreview: FwLMCbs47K
abstract: Diffusion Policy (DP) enables robots to learn complex behaviors by imitating
  expert demonstrations through action diffusion. However, in practical applications,
  hardware limitations often degrade data quality, while real-time constraints restrict
  model inference to instantaneous state and scene observations. These limitations
  seriously reduce the efficacy of learning from expert demonstrations, resulting
  in failures in object localization, grasp planning, and long-horizon task execution.
  To address these challenges, we propose Causal Diffusion Policy (CDP), a novel transformer-based
  diffusion model that enhances action prediction by conditioning on historical action
  sequences, thereby enabling more coherent and context-aware visuomotor policy learning.
  In practice, to further mitigate the computational cost associated with autoregressive
  inference, a caching mechanism is also introduced to store attention key-value pairs
  from previous timesteps, substantially reducing redundant computations during execution.
  Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments, spanning diverse
  2D and 3D manipulation tasks, demonstrate that CDP uniquely leverages historical
  action sequences to achieve significantly higher accuracy than existing methods.
  Moreover, even when faced with degraded observation quality, CDP maintains remarkable
  precision by reasoning through temporal continuity, which highlights its practical
  robustness for robotic control under realistic, imperfect conditions.

title: 'RoboArena: Distributed Real-World Evaluation of Generalist Robot Policies'
section: Oral
openreview: cpmwi3Xwcr
abstract: 'Comprehensive, unbiased, and comparable evaluation of modern generalist
  policies is uniquely challenging: existing approaches for robot benchmarking typically
  rely on heavy standardization, either by specifying fixed evaluation tasks and environments,
  or by hosting centralized "robot challenges", and do not readily scale to evaluating
  generalist policies across a broad range of tasks and environments. In this work,
  we propose RoboArena, a new approach for scalable evaluation of generalist robot
  policies in the real world. Instead of standardizing evaluations around fixed tasks,
  environments, or locations, we propose to crowd-source evaluations across a distributed
  network of evaluators. Importantly, evaluators can freely choose the tasks and environments
  they evaluate on, enabling easy scaling of diversity, but they are required to perform
  double-blind evaluations over pairs of policies. Then, by aggregating preference
  feedback from pairwise comparisons across diverse tasks and environments, we can
  derive a ranking of policies. We instantiate our approach across a network of evaluators
  at seven academic institutions using the DROID robot platform. Through more than
  600 pairwise real-robot evaluation episodes across seven generalist policies, we
  demonstrate that our crowd-sourced approach can more accurately rank the performance
  of existing generalist policies than conventional, centralized evaluation approaches,
  while being more scalable, resilient, and trustworthy. We open our evaluation network
  to the community and hope that it can enable more accessible comparisons of generalist
  robot policies.'

  Dexterous Grasping'

abstract: Dexterous robotic hands enable versatile interactions through the flexibility
  and adaptability of a multi-finger setup, allowing for a wise range of task-specific
  grasp configurations in diverse environments. However, access to diverse and high-quality
  grasp data is essential to fully exploit the capabilities of dexterous hands, be
  it to train grasp prediction models from point clouds, train manipulation policies,
  or to support high-level task planning with a broader range of action options. Existing
  approaches for dataset generation rely on sampling-based algorithms or simplified
  force-closure analysis, which tend to converge to power grasps and often exhibit
  limited diversity. In this work, we propose a method to synthesize large-scale,
  diverse, and physically feasible grasps that additionally go beyond simple power
  grasps to more refined manipulation, such as pinches or tri-finger precision grasps.
  We introduce a rigorous differentiable energy formulation of force closure, implicitly
  defined through a Quadratic Program (QP). In addition, we present an adjusted optimization
  method (MALA*) that improves performance by dynamically rejecting gradient steps
  based on the global sample distribution. We extensively evaluate our approach and
  demonstrate significant improvements in both grasp diversity and the stability of
  final grasp predictions. Finally, we provide a new, large-scale grasp dataset for
  the 5’700 objects from DexGraspNet, consisting of five different grippers and three
  different grasp types.

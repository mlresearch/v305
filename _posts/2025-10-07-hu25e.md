  Navigation'
section: Poster

abstract: We present See, Point, Fly (SPF), a training-free aerial vision-and-language
  navigation (AVLN) framework built atop vision-language models (VLMs). SPF is capable
  of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructions in any kind
  of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that treat action prediction
  as a text generation task, our key insight is to consider action prediction for
  AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF harness VLMs to decompose vague language
  instructions into iterative annotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along
  with the predicted traveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into
  3D displacement vectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively
  adjusts the traveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably,
  SPF performs navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow
  dynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL
  simulation benchmark, out performing the previous best method by an absolute margin
  of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong baselines by
  a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to highlight the
  effectiveness of our design choice. Lastly, SPF shows remarkable generalization
  to different VLMs.

title: Planning from Point Clouds over Continuous Actions for Multi-object Rearrangement
section: Oral
openreview: XF69ltYlMU
abstract: Multi-object rearrangement is a challenging task that requires robots to
  reason about a physical 3D scene and the effects of a sequence of actions. While
  traditional task planning methods are shown to be effective for long-horizon manipulation,
  they require discretizing the continuous state and action space into symbolic descriptions
  of objects, object relationships, and actions. Our proposed method is instead able
  to take in a partially-observed point cloud observation of an initial scene and
  plan to a goal-satisfying configuration, without needing to discretize the set of
  actions or object relationships. To enable this, we formulate the planning problem
  as an A* search over the space of possible point cloud rearrangements. We sample
  point cloud transformations from a learned, domain-specific prior and then search
  for a sequence of such point cloud transformations that leads from the initial state
  to a goal. We evaluate our method in terms of task planning success and task execution
  success on a real-world, multi-step table bussing environment and a simulation block
  stacking environment. We experimentally demonstrate that our method produces successful
  plans and outperforms a policy-learning approach; we also perform ablations that
  show the importance of search in our approach.

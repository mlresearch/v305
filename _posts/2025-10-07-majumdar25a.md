title: 'Predictive Red Teaming: Breaking Policies Without Breaking Robots'
section: Poster
openreview: qAGHsCsA1O
abstract: 'Visuomotor policies trained via imitation learning are capable of performing
  challenging manipulation tasks, but are often extremely brittle to lighting, visual
  distractors, and object locations. These vulnerabilities can depend unpredictably
  on the specifics of training, and are challenging to expose without time-consuming
  and expensive hardware evaluations. We propose the problem of predictive red teaming:
  discovering vulnerabilities of a policy with respect to environmental factors, and
  predicting the corresponding performance degradation without hardware evaluations
  in off-nominal scenarios. In order to achieve this, we develop RoboART: an automated
  red teaming (ART) pipeline that (1) modifies nominal observations using generative
  image editing to vary different environmental factors, and (2) predicts performance
  under each variation using a policy-specific anomaly detector executed on edited
  observations. Experiments across 500+ hardware trials in twelve off-nominal conditions
  for visuomotor diffusion policies demonstrate that RoboART predicts performance
  degradation with high accuracy (less than 0.19 average difference between predicted
  and real success rates). We also demonstrate how predictive red teaming enables
  targeted data collection: fine-tuning with data collected under conditions predicted
  to be adverse boosts baseline performance by 2â€“7x.'

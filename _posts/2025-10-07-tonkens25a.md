title: 'From Space to Time: Enabling Adaptive Safety with Learned Value Functions
  via Disturbance Recasting'
section: Poster
openreview: GUgIpVTC1T
abstract: Safe operation is essential for autonomous systems in safety-critical environments
  such as urban air mobility.  Value function-based safety filters provide formal
  guarantees on safety, wrapping learned or planning-based controllers with a layer
  of protection.  Recent approaches leverage offline learned value functions to scale
  these safety filters to high-dimensional systems.  Yet these methods assume detailed
  prior knowledge of all possible sources of model mismatch, in the form of disturbances,
  in the environment – information that is typically unavailable in real world settings.  Even
  in well-mapped environments like urban canyons or industrial sites, drones encounter
  complex, spatially-varying disturbances arising from payload-drone interaction,
  turbulent airflow, and other environmental factors.  We introduce Space2Time, which
  enables safe and adaptive deployment of offline-learned safety filters under unknown,
  spatially-varying disturbances.  The key idea is to reparameterize spatial disturbances
  as a time-varying formulation, allowing the use of temporally varying precomputed
  value functions during online operation.  We validate Space2Time through extensive
  simulations on diverse quadcopter models and real-world hardware experiments, demonstrating
  significantly improved safety performance over worst-case and naive baselines.

title: Enabling Long(er) Horizon Imitation for Manipulation Tasks by Modeling Subgoal
  Transitions
section: Poster
openreview: fBRqCMqVyS
abstract: Imitation-based policy training for long-horizon manipulation tasks involving
  multi-step object interactions is often susceptible to compounding action errors.
  Contemporary methods discover semantic subgoals embedded within the overall task,
  decomposing the overall task into tractable shorter-horizon goal-conditioned policy
  learning. However, policy deployment requires iteratively estimating $\textit{which}$
  subgoal is being pursued and $\textit{when}$ it is achieved. We observe the brittleness
  of conventional $\textit{heuristic}$-based approaches (ad hoc threshold based),
  particularly for long-horizon imitation, since pursuing an incorrect subgoal can
  lead the robot policy to experience out of distribution states. In this work, we
  introduce two policy architectures for modeling subgoal transitions within a policy
  learning loop for long-horizon tasks. The first model autoregressively predicts
  the likelihood of the next subgoal transition, while the second uses cross-attention
  (via a transformer-based architecture) and implicitly models smooth and continuous
  transitions. We evaluate our models on $25$ simulated tasks on Franka Kitchen, $6$
  real-world table-top tasks and $18$ simulated tasks on a new corpus (Franka-Long
  Horizon Tasks (LHT)) focused on tasks with rich object interactions over long episode
  lengths. Experimental results show significant improvements in learning efficacy,
  task success rates and generalization to out-of-distribution settings- extending
  horizon lengths for imitating manipulation tasks $\textit{from long to long(er)}$.

title: 'SLAC: Simulation-Pretrained Latent Action Space for Whole-Body Real-World
  RL'
section: Poster

abstract: Building capable household and industrial robots requires mastering the
  control of versatile, high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems such as mobile manipulators.
  While reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise for autonomously acquiring robot
  control policies, scaling it to high-DoF embodiments remains challenging. Direct
  RL in the real world demands both safe exploration and high sample efficiency, which
  are difficult to achieve in practice. Sim-to-real RL, on the other hand, is often
  brittle due to the reality gap. This paper introduces SLAC, a method that renders
  real-world RL feasible for complex embodiments by leveraging a low-fidelity simulator
  to pretrain a task-agnostic latent action space. SLAC trains this latent action
  space via a customized unsupervised skill discovery method designed to promote temporal
  abstraction, disentanglement, and safety, thereby facilitating efficient downstream
  learning. Once a latent action space is learned, SLAC uses it as the action interface
  for a novel off-policy RL algorithm to autonomously learn downstream tasks through
  real-world interactions. We evaluate SLAC against existing methods on a suite of
  bimanual mobile manipulation tasks, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance.
  Notably, SLAC learns contact-rich whole-body tasks in under an hour of real-world
  interactions, without relying on any demonstrations or hand-crafted behavior priors.

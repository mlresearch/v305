title: 'D-Cubed: Latent Diffusion Trajectory Optimisation for Dexterous Deformable
  Manipulation'
section: Poster
openreview: 5htQM8jqOe
abstract: Mastering deformable object manipulation often necessitates the use of anthropomorphic,
  high-degree-of-freedom robot hands capable of precise, contact-rich control. However,
  current trajectory optimisation methods often struggle in these settings due to
  the large search space and the sparse task information available from shape-matching
  cost functions, particularly when contact is absent. In this work, we propose D-Cubed,
  a novel trajectory optimisation method using a latent diffusion model (LDM) trained
  from a task-agnostic play dataset to solve dexterous deformable object manipulation
  tasks. D-Cubed learns a skill-latent space that encodes short-horizon actions from
  a play dataset using a VAE and trains a LDM to compose the skill latents into a
  skill trajectory, representing a long-horizon action trajectory. To optimise a trajectory
  for a target task, we introduce a novel gradient-free guided sampling method that
  employs the Cross-Entropy method within the reverse diffusion process. In particular,
  D-Cubed samples a small number of noisy skill trajectories using the LDM for exploration
  and evaluates the trajectories in simulation. Then D-Cubed selects the trajectory
  with the lowest cost for the subsequent reverse process. This effectively explores
  promising solution areas and optimises the sampled trajectories towards a target
  task throughout the reverse diffusion process. Through empirical evaluation on a
  published benchmark of dexterous deformable object manipulation tasks, we demonstrate
  that D-Cubed outperforms traditional trajectory optimisation and competitive baseline
  approaches by a significant margin.

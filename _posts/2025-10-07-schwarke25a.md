title: Learning Deployable Locomotion Control via Differentiable Simulation
section: Poster
openreview: KHWIHwnYbn
abstract: Differentiable simulators promise to improve sample efficiency in robot
  learning by providing analytic gradients of the system dynamics. Yet, their application
  to contact-rich tasks like locomotion is complicated by the inherently non-smooth
  nature of contact, impeding effective gradient-based optimization. Existing works
  thus often rely on soft contact models that provide smooth gradients but lack physical
  accuracy, constraining results to simulation. To address this limitation, we propose
  a differentiable contact model designed to provide informative gradients while maintaining
  high physical fidelity. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by training
  a quadrupedal locomotion policy within our differentiable simulator leveraging analytic
  gradients and successfully transferring the learned policy zero-shot to the real
  world. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first successful sim-to-real
  transfer of a legged locomotion policy learned entirely within a differentiable
  simulator, establishing the feasibility of using differentiable simulation for real-world
  locomotion control.

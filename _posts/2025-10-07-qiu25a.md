abstract: Training manipulation policies for humanoid robots with diverse data enhances
  their robustness and generalization across tasks and platforms. However, learning
  solely from robot demonstrations is labor-intensive, requiring expensive tele-operated
  data collection,n which is difficult to scale. This paper investigates a more scalable
  data source, egocentric human demonstrations, to serve as cross-embodiment training
  data for robot learning. We mitigate the embodiment gap between humanoids and humans
  from both the data and modeling perspectives. We collect an egocentric task-oriented
  dataset that is directly aligned with humanoid manipulation demonstrations. We then
  train a human-humanoid behavior policy, which we term Human Action Transformer (HAT).
  The state-action space of HAT is unified for both humans and humanoid robots and
  can be differentiably retargeted to robot actions. Co-trained with smaller-scale
  robot data, HAT directly models humanoid robots and humans as different embodiments
  without additional supervision. We show that human data improves both the generalization
  and robustness of HAT with significantly better data collection efficiency.

title: 'GENNAV: Polygon Mask Generation for Generalized Referring Navigable Regions'
section: Poster
openreview: 2y7TSgwqAB
abstract: 'We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from
  a natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
  This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and segmentation
  mask generation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous boundaries.
  Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target regions, in addition
  to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these limitations, we propose GENNAV,
  which predicts target existence and generates segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type
  target regions.  To evaluate GENNAV, we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive,
  which includes three distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target.
  GENNAV achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
  metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
  operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot transfer
  performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline methods and demonstrated
  its robustness across diverse real-world environments.'

title: 'TWIST: Teleoperated Whole-Body Imitation System'
section: Poster
openreview: htgNQHa6Ta
abstract: Teleoperating humanoid robots in a whole-body manner marks a fundamental
  step toward developing general-purpose robotic intelligence, with human motion providing
  an ideal interface for controlling all degrees of freedom. Yet, most current humanoid
  teleoperation systems fall short of enabling coordinated whole-body behavior, typically
  limiting themselves to isolated locomotion or manipulation tasks. We present the
  Teleoperated Whole-Body Imitation System (TWIST), a system for humanoid teleoperation
  through whole-body motion imitation. We first generate reference motion clips by
  retargeting human motion capture data to the humanoid robot. We then develop a robust,
  adaptive, and responsive whole-body controller using a combination of reinforcement
  learning and behavior cloning (RL+BC). Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate
  how incorporating privileged future motion frames and real-world motion capture
  (MoCap) data improves tracking accuracy. TWIST enables real-world humanoid robots
  to achieve unprecedented, versatile, and coordinated whole-body motor skills—spanning
  whole-body manipulation, legged manipulation, locomotion, and expressive movement—using
  a single unified neural network controller.

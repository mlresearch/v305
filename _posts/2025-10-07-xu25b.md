title: 'DexUMI: Using Human Hand as the Universal Manipulation Interface for Dexterous
  Manipulation'
section: Oral
openreview: XrgRvBklWu
abstract: We present DexUMI - a data collection and policy learning framework that
  uses the human hand as the natural interface to transfer dexterous manipulation
  skills to various robot hands. DexUMI incorporates hardware and software adaptations
  to minimize the embodiment gap between the human hand and various robot hands. The
  hardware adaptation bridges the kinematics gap with a wearable hand exoskeleton.
  It allows direct haptic feedback in manipulation data collection and adapts human
  motion to feasible robot hand motion. Our software adaptation bridges the visual
  gap by replacing the human hand in video data with high-fidelity robot hand inpainting.
  We demonstrate DexUMIâ€™s capabilities through comprehensive real-world experiments
  on two different dexterous robot hand hardware platforms, achieving an average task
  success rate of 86%.

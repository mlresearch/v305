title: 'LodeStar: Long-horizon Dexterity via Synthetic Data Augmentation from Human
  Demonstrations'
section: Poster
openreview: 6yB6AX8aSU
abstract: Developing robotic systems capable of robustly executing long-horizon manipulation
  tasks with human-level dexterity is challenging, as such tasks require both physical
  dexterity and seamless sequencing of manipulation skills while robustly handling
  environment variations. While imitation learning offers a promising approach, acquiring
  comprehensive datasets is resource-intensive. In this work, we propose a learning
  framework and system LodeStar that automatically decomposes task demonstrations
  into semantically meaningful skills using off-the-shelf foundation models, and generates
  diverse synthetic demonstration datasets from a few human demos through reinforcement
  learning. These sim-augmented datasets enable robust skill training, with a Skill
  Routing Transformer (SRT) policy effectively chaining the learned skills together
  to execute complex long-horizon manipulation tasks. Experimental evaluations on
  three challenging real-world long-horizon dexterous manipulation tasks demonstrate
  that our approach significantly improves task performance and robustness compared
  to previous baselines. Videos are available at lodestar-robot.github.io.

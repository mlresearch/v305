title: 'SimShear: Sim-to-Real Shear-based Tactile Servoing'
section: Poster
openreview: MJmzIunyBy
abstract: 'We present SimShear: a sim-to-real pipeline for tactile control that allows
  use of shear information without explicitly modeling shear dynamics in simulation.
  Shear, which arises from lateral movements across contact surfaces, are critical
  for tasks involving dynamic object interactions but are challenging to simulate.
  We introduce shPix2pix: a shear-conditioned U-Net GAN that transforms simulated
  tactile images absent of shear plus a vector encoding shear information into realistic
  equivalents that include shear deformations, and show this outperforms baseline
  pix2pix methods for simulating tactile images and pose/shear prediction. This is
  applied to two control tasks using a pair of low-cost desktop robotic arms equipped
  with a vision-based tactile sensor: first, a tactile tracking task, where a follower
  arm tracks a surface moved by the leader arm; second, a collaborative co-lift task,
  where both arms jointly hold an object while the leader arm moves along a prescribed
  trajectory. Our method maintain contact errors within 1-2 mm across varied trajectories
  where shear sensing is essential for task performance. This work validates the use
  of sim-to-real shear modeling with rigid-body simulators, opening new possibilities
  for simulation in tactile robotics.'

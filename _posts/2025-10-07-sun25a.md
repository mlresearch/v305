title: 'FlashBack: Consistency Model-Accelerated Shared Autonomy'
section: Poster
openreview: zk4fRmHF0Q
abstract: 'Abstract: Shared autonomy is an enabling technology that provides users
  with control authority over robots that would otherwise be difficult if not impossible
  to directly control. Yet, standard methods make assumptions that limit their adoption
  in practice—for example, prior knowledge of the user’s goals or the objective (i.e.,
  reward) function that they wish to optimize, knowledge of the user’s policy, or
  query-level access to the user during training. Diffusion-based approaches to shared
  autonomy do not make such assumptions and instead only require access to demonstrations
  of desired behaviors, while allowing the user to maintain control authority. However,
  these advantages have come at the expense of high computational complexity, which
  has made real-time shared autonomy all but impossible. To overcome this limitation,
  we propose Consistency Shared Autonomy (CSA), a shared autonomy framework that employs
  a consistency model-based formulation of diffusion. Key to CSA is that it employs
  the distilled probability flow of ordinary differential equations (PF ODE) to generate
  high-fidelity samples in a single step. This results in inference speeds significantly
  than what is possible with previous diffusion-based approaches to shared autonomy,
  enabling real-time assistance in complex domains with only a single function evaluation.
  Further, by intervening on flawed actions at intermediate states of the PF ODE,
  CSA enables varying levels of assistance. We evaluate CSA on a variety of challenging
  simulated and real-world robot control problems, demonstrating significant improvements
  over state-of-the-art methods both in terms of task performance and computational
  efficiency.'

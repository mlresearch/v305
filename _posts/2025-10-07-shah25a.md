title: 'From Real World to Logic and Back: Learning Generalizable Relational Concepts
  For Long Horizon Robot Planning'
section: Poster
openreview: 1cA6OYsfoJ
abstract: Humans efficiently generalize from limited demonstrations, but robots still
  struggle to transfer learned knowledge to complex, unseen tasks with longer horizons
  and increased complexity.  We propose the first known method enabling robots to
  autonomously invent relational concepts directly from small sets of unannotated,
  unsegmented demonstrations. The learned symbolic concepts are grounded into logic-based
  world models, facilitating efficient zero-shot generalization to significantly more
  complex tasks. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance
  comparable to hand-crafted models, successfully scaling execution horizons and handling
  up to 18 times more objects than seen in training, providing the first autonomous
  framework for learning transferable symbolic abstractions from raw robot trajectories.

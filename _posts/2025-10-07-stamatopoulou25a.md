title: 'SDS – See it, Do it, Sorted: Quadruped Skill Synthesis from Single Video Demonstration'
section: Poster
openreview: kbrb6W7bUL
abstract: 'Imagine a robot learning locomotion skills from any single video, without
  labels or reward engineering. We introduce SDS ("See it. Do it. Sorted."), an automated
  pipeline for skill acquisition from unstructured video demonstrations. Using GPT-4o,
  SDS applies novel prompting techniques, in the form of spatio-temporal grid-based
  visual encoding (Gv) and structured input decomposition (SUS). These produce executable
  reward functions (RF) from raw input videos. The RFs are used to train PPO policies
  and are optimized through closed-loop evolution, using training footage and performance
  metrics as self-supervised signals. SDS allows quadrupeds (e.g., Unitree Go1) to
  learn four gaits—trot, bound, pace, and hop—achieving 100% gait matching fidelity,
  Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance in the order of 10^-6, and stable locomotion
  with zero failures, both in simulation and the real world. SDS generalizes to morphologically
  different quadrupeds (e.g., ANYmal) and outperforms prior work in data efficiency,
  training time, and engineering effort. Our code is open-source under: https://sdsreview.github.io/SDS_ANONYM/'

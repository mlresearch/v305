title: First Order Model-Based RL through Decoupled Backpropagation
section: Poster
openreview: 2dXMfk3qRU
abstract: 'There is growing interest in reinforcement learning (RL) methods that leverage
  the simulatorâ€™s derivatives to improve learning efficiency. While early gradient-based
  approaches have demonstrated superior performance compared to derivative-free methods,
  accessing simulator gradients is often impractical due to their implementation cost
  or unavailability. Model-based RL (MBRL) can approximate these gradients via learned
  dynamics models, but the solver efficiency suffers from compounding prediction errors
  during training rollouts, which can degrade policy performance. We propose an approach
  that decouples trajectory generation from gradient computation: trajectories are
  unrolled using a simulator, while gradients are computed via backpropagation through
  a learned differentiable model of the simulator. This hybrid design enables efficient
  and consistent first-order policy optimization, even when simulator gradients are
  unavailable, as well as learning a critic from simulation rollouts, which is more
  accurate. Our method achieves the sample efficiency and speed of specialized optimizers
  such as SHAC, while maintaining the generality of standard approaches like PPO and
  avoiding ill behaviors observed in other first-order MBRL methods. We empirically
  validate our algorithm on benchmark control tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness
  on a real Go2 quadruped robot, across both quadrupedal and bipedal locomotion tasks.'

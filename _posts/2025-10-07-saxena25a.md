title: 'GraphEQA: Using 3D Semantic Scene Graphs for Real-time Embodied Question Answering'
section: Poster
openreview: Yy9EVIajH5
abstract: In Embodied Question Answering (EQA), agents must explore and develop a
  semantic understanding of an unseen environment in order to answer a situated question
  with confidence. This remains a challenging problem in robotics, due to the difficulties
  in obtaining useful semantic representations, updating these representations online,
  and leveraging prior world knowledge for efficient exploration and planning. Aiming
  to address these limitations, we propose GraphEQA, a novel approach that utilizes
  real-time 3D metric-semantic scene graphs (3DSGs) and task relevant images as multi-modal
  memory for grounding Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to perform EQA tasks in unseen
  environments. We employ a hierarchical planning approach that exploits the hierarchical
  nature of 3DSGs for structured planning and semantic-guided exploration. We evaluate
  GraphEQA in simulation on two benchmark datasets, HM-EQA and OpenEQA, and demonstrate
  that it outperforms key baselines by completing EQA tasks with higher success rates
  and fewer planning steps, and further demonstrate GraphEQA in two separate real
  world environments. Videos and code are available at https://grapheqa.github.io.

title: 'SAIL: Faster-than-Demonstration Execution of Imitation Learning Policies'
section: Oral
openreview: EGSSHukI05
abstract: 'Offline Imitation Learning (IL) methods such as Behavior Cloning are effective
  at acquiring complex robotic manipulation skills.  However, existing IL-trained
  policies are confined to execute the task at the same speed as shown in demonstration
  data. This limits the task throughput of a robotic system, a critical requirement
  for applications such as industrial automation. In this paper, we introduce and
  formalize the novel problem of enabling faster-than-demonstration execution of visuomotor
  policies and identify fundamental challenges in robot dynamics and state-action
  distribution shifts. We instantiate the key insights as SAIL (Speed Adaptation for
  Imitation Learning), a full-stack system integrating four tightly-connected components:
  (1) a consistency-preserving action inference algorithm for smooth motion at high
  speed, (2) high-fidelity tracking of controller-invariant motion targets, (3) adaptive
  speed modulation that dynamically adjusts execution speed based on motion complexity,
  and (4) action scheduling to handle real-world system latencies.  Experiments on
  12 tasks across simulation and two real, distinct robot platforms shows that SAIL
  achieves up to a {4$\times$ speedup} over demonstration speed in simulation and
  up to {3.2$\times$ speedup} in the real world. Additional detail is available at

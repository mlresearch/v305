title: 'AirExo-2: Scaling up Generalizable Robotic Imitation Learning with Low-Cost
  Exoskeletons'
section: Oral
openreview: ksOrtEgIC0
abstract: 'Scaling up robotic imitation learning for real-world applications requires
  efficient and scalable demonstration collection methods. While teleoperation is
  effective, it depends on costly and inflexible robot platforms. In-the-wild demonstrations
  offer a promising alternative, but existing collection devices have key limitations:
  handheld setups offer limited observational coverage, and whole-body systems often
  require fine-tuning with robot data due to domain gaps. To address these challenges,
  we present AirExo-2, a low-cost exoskeleton system for large-scale in-the-wild data
  collection, along with visual adaptors that transform collected data into pseudo-robot
  demonstrations suitable for policy learning. We further introduce RISE-2, a generalizable
  imitation learning policy that fuses 3D spatial and 2D semantic perception for robust
  manipulations. Experiments show that RISE-2 outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods
  on both in-domain and generalization evaluations. Trained solely on adapted in-the-wild
  data produced by AirExo-2, RISE-2 achieves comparable performance to policies trained
  with teleoperated data, highlighting the effectiveness and potential of AirExo-2
  for scalable and generalizable imitation learning.'

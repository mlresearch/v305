title: 'SafeBimanual: Diffusion-based trajectory optimization for safe bimanual manipulation'
section: Poster
openreview: Q0H9xlNdVm
abstract: Bimanual manipulation has been widely applied in household services and
  manufacturing, which enables the complex task completion with coordination requirements.
  Recent diffusion-based policy learning approaches have achieved promising performance
  in modeling action distributions for bimanual manipulation. However, they ignored
  the physical safety constraints of bimanual manipulation, which leads to the dangerous
  behaviors with damage to robots and objects.  To this end, we propose a test-time
  trajectory optimization framework named SafeBimanual for any pre-trained diffusion-based
  bimanual manipulation policies, which imposes the safety constraints on bimanual
  actions to avoid dangerous robot behaviors with improved success rate. Specifically,
  we design diverse cost functions for safety constraints in different dual-arm cooperation
  patterns including avoidance of tearing objects and collision between arms and objects,
  which optimizes the manipulator trajectories with guided sampling of diffusion denoising
  process. Moreover, we employ a vision-language model (VLM) to schedule the cost
  functions by specifying keypoints and corresponding pairwise relationship, so that
  the optimal safety constraint is dynamically generated in the entire bimanual manipulation
  process. SafeBimanual demonstrates superiority on 8 simulated tasks in RoboTwin
  with a 11.1% increase in success rate and a 18.9% reduction in unsafe interactions
  over state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world
  tasks further verify its practical value by improving the success rate by 32.5%.

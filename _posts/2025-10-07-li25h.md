title: 'CLONE: Closed-Loop Whole-Body Humanoid Teleoperation for Long-Horizon Tasks'
section: Poster
openreview: Bw9NHYjDqR
abstract: 'Humanoid robot teleoperation plays a vital role in demonstrating and collecting
  data for complex interactions. Current methods suffer from two key limitations:
  (1) restricted controllability due to decoupled upper- and lower-body control, and
  (2) severe drift caused by open-loop execution. These issues prevent humanoid robots
  from performing coordinated whole-body motions required for long-horizon loco-manipulation
  tasks. We introduce CLONE, a whole-body teleoperation system that overcomes these
  challenges through three key contributions: (1) a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) whole-body
  control policy that enables complex coordinated movements, such as “picking up an
  object from the ground” and “placing it in a distant bin”; (2) a closed-loop error
  correction mechanism using LiDAR odometry, reducing translational drift to 12cm
  over 8.9-meter trajectories; and (3) a systematic data augmentation strategy that
  ensures robust performance under diverse, previously unseen operator poses. In extensive
  experiments, CLONE demonstrates robust performance across diverse scenarios while
  maintaining stable whole-body control. These capabilities significantly advance
  humanoid robotics by enabling the collection of long-horizon interaction data and
  establishing a foundation for more sophisticated humanoid-environment interaction
  in both research and practical applications.'

title: 'WoMAP: World Models For Embodied Open-Vocabulary Object Localization'
section: Poster
openreview: KXzkAje2uQ
abstract: 'Active object localization remains a critical challenge for robots, requiring
  efficient exploration of partially observable environments. However, state-of-the-art
  robot policies either struggle to generalize beyond demonstration datasets (e.g.,
  imitation learning methods) or fail to generate physically grounded actions (e.g.,
  VLMs). To address these limitations, we introduce WoMAP (World Models for Active
  Perception): a recipe for training open-vocabulary object localization policies
  that: (i) uses a Gaussian Splatting-based real-to-sim-to-real pipeline for scalable
  data generation without the need for expert demonstrations, (ii) distills dense
  rewards signals from open-vocabulary object detectors, and (iii) leverages a latent
  world model for dynamics and rewards prediction to ground high-level action proposals
  at inference time. Rigorous simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate WoMAPâ€™s
  superior performance in a wide range of zero-shot object localization tasks, with
  a 63% success rate compared to 10%success rate compared to a VLM baseline, and only
  a 10 - 20% drop in performance when directly transferring from sim to real.'

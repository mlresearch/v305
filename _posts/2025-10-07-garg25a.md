title: 'ObjectReact: Learning Object-Relative Control for Visual Navigation'
section: Poster
openreview: thVTNoJ4Lx
abstract: 'Visual navigation using only a single camera and a topological map has
  recently become an appealing alternative to methods that require additional sensors
  and 3D maps. This is typically achieved through an "image-relative" approach to
  estimating control from a given pair of current observation and subgoal image. However,
  image-level representations of the world have limitations because images are strictly
  tied to the agent’s pose and embodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property
  of the map, offer an embodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation.
  In this work, we present a new paradigm of learning "object-relative" control that
  exhibits several desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without
  strictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction problem
  can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high invariance
  can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across both training-testing
  and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric map representation in the
  form of a relative" 3D scene graph, which is used to obtain more informative object-level
  global path planning costs. We train a local controller, dubbed "ObjectReact", conditioned
  directly on a high-level “WayObject Costmap” representation that eliminates the
  need for an explicit RGB input. We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative
  control over its image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and
  multiple navigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding capability,
  e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction. We further show that
  our sim-only policy is able to generalize well to real-world indoor environments.'

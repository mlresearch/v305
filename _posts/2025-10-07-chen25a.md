abstract: Robot chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT) – wherein a model predicts helpful
  intermediate representations before choosing actions – provides an effective method
  for improving the generalization and performance of robot policies, especially vision-language-action
  models (VLAs). While such approaches have been shown to improve performance and
  generalization, they suffer from core limitations, like needing specialized robot
  reasoning data and slow inference speeds. To design new robot reasoning approaches
  that address these issues, a more complete characterization of why reasoning helps
  policy performance is critical. We hypothesize several mechanisms by which robot
  reasoning improves policies – (1) better representation learning, (2) improved learning
  curricularization, and (3) increased expressivity – then devise simple variants
  of robot CoT reasoning to isolate and test each one. We find that learning to generate
  reasonings does lead to better VLA representations, while attending to the reasonings
  aids in actually leveraging these features for improved action prediction. Our results
  provide us with a better understanding of why CoT reasoning helps VLAs, which we
  use to introduce two simple and lightweight alternative recipes for robot reasoning.
  Our proposed approaches achieve significant performance gains over non-reasoning
  policies, state-of-the-art results on the LIBERO-90 benchmark, and a 3x inference
  speedup compared to standard robot reasoning.

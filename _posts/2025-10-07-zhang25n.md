title: Mastering Multi-Drone Volleyball through Hierarchical Co-Self-Play Reinforcement
  Learning
section: Poster
openreview: 23FdMTxEh7
abstract: 'In this paper, we tackle the problem of learning to play 3v3 multi-drone
  volleyball, a new embodied competitive task that requires both high-level strategic
  coordination and low-level agile control. The task is turn-based, multi-agent, and
  physically grounded, posing significant challenges due to its long-horizon dependencies,
  tight inter-agent coupling, and the underactuated dynamics of quadrotors. To address
  this, we propose Hierarchical Co-Self-Play (HCSP), a hierarchical reinforcement
  learning framework that separates centralized high-level strategic decision-making
  from decentralized low-level motion control. We design a three-stage population-based
  training pipeline to enable both strategy and skill to emerge from scratch without
  expert demonstrations: (I) training diverse low-level skills, (II) learning high-level
  strategy via self-play with fixed low-level controllers, and (III) joint fine-tuning
  through co-self-play. Experiments show that HCSP achieves superior performance,
  outperforming non-hierarchical self-play and rule-based hierarchical baselines with
  an average 82.9% win rate and a 71.5% win rate against the two-stage variant. Moreover,
  co-self-play leads to emergent team behaviors such as role switching and coordinated
  formations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our hierarchical design and training
  scheme.'

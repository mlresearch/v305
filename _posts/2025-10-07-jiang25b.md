  Everyday Household Activities'

abstract: 'Real-world household tasks present significant challenges for mobile manipulation
  robots. An analysis of existing robotics benchmarks reveals that successful task
  performance hinges on three key whole-body control capabilities: bimanual coordination,
  stable and precise navigation, and extensive end-effector reachability. Achieving
  these capabilities requires careful hardware design, but the resulting system complexity
  further complicates visuomotor policy learning. To address these challenges, we
  introduce the BEHAVIOR Robot Suite (BRS), a comprehensive framework for whole-body
  manipulation in diverse household tasks. Built on a bimanual, wheeled robot with
  a 4-DoF torso, BRS integrates a cost-effective whole-body teleoperation interface
  for data collection and a novel algorithm for learning whole-body visuomotor policies.
  We evaluate BRS on five challenging household tasks that not only emphasize the
  three core capabilities but also introduce additional complexities, such as long-range
  navigation, interaction with articulated and deformable objects, and manipulation
  in confined spaces. We believe that BRSâ€™s integrated robotic embodiment, data collection
  interface, and learning framework mark a significant step toward enabling real-world
  whole-body manipulation for everyday household tasks. BRS is open-sourced at https://behavior-robot-suite.github.io/.'

  Manipulation'

abstract: How can robot manipulation policies generalize to novel tasks involving
  unseen object types and new motions? In this paper, we provide a solution in terms
  of predicting motion information from web data through human video generation and
  conditioning a robot policy on the generated video. Instead of attempting to scale
  robot data collection which is expensive, we show how we can leverage video generation
  models trained on easily available web data, for enabling generalization. \textit{Our
  approach Gen2Act casts language-conditioned manipulation as zero-shot human video
  generation followed by execution with a single policy conditioned on the generated
  video.} To train the policy, we use an order of magnitude less robot interaction
  data compared to what the video prediction model was trained on. Gen2Act doesnâ€™t
  require fine-tuning the video model at all and we directly use a pre-trained model
  for generating human videos. Our results on diverse real-world scenarios show how
  Gen2Act enables manipulating unseen object types and performing novel motions for
  tasks not present in the robot data.

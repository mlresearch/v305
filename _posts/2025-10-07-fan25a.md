title: 'Long-VLA: Unleashing Long-Horizon Capability of Vision Language Action Model
  for Robot Manipulation'
section: Poster
openreview: irh5o90Mj1
abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have become a cornerstone in robotic
  policy learning, leveraging large-scale multimodal data for robust and scalable
  control. However, existing VLA frameworks primarily address short-horizon tasks,
  and their effectiveness on long-horizon, multi-step robotic manipulation remains
  limited due to challenges in skill chaining and subtask dependencies. In this work,
  we introduce Long-VLA, the first end-to-end VLA model specifically designed for
  long-horizon robotic tasks. Our approach features a novel phase-aware input masking
  strategy that adaptively segments each subtask into moving and interaction phases,
  enabling the model to focus on phase-relevant sensory cues and enhancing subtask
  compatibility. This unified strategy preserves the scalability and data efficiency
  of VLA training, and our architecture-agnostic module can be seamlessly integrated
  into existing VLA models. We further propose the L-CALVIN benchmark to systematically
  evaluate long-horizon manipulation. Extensive experiments on both simulated and
  real-world tasks demonstrate that Long-VLA significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art
  methods, establishing a new baseline for long-horizon robotic control.

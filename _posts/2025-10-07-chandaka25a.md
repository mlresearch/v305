title: Human-like Navigation in a World Built for Humans
section: Poster
openreview: nMiyWyNhQx
abstract: When navigating in a man-made environment they haven’t visited before—like
  an office building—humans employ behaviors such as reading signs and asking others
  for directions. These behaviors help humans reach their destinations efficiently
  by reducing the need to search through large areas. Existing robot navigation systems
  lack the ability to execute such behaviors and are thus highly inefficient at navigating
  within large environments. We present ReasonNav, a modular navigation system which
  integrates these human-like navigation skills by leveraging the reasoning capabilites
  of a vision-language model (VLM). We design compact input and output abstractions
  based on navigation landmarks, allowing the VLM to focus on language understanding
  and reasoning. We evaluate ReasonNav on real and simulated navigation tasks and
  show that the agent successfully employs higher-order reasoning to navigate efficiently
  in large, complex buildings.

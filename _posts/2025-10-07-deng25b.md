title: Subteaming and Adaptive Formation Control for Coordinated Multi-Robot Navigation
section: Poster
openreview: ZmASpafbOc
abstract: 'Coordinated multi-robot navigation is essential for robots to operate as
  a team in diverse environments.  During navigation, robot teams usually need to
  maintain specific formations, such as circular formations to protect human teammates
  at the center.  However, in complex scenarios such as narrow corridors, rigidly
  preserving predefined formations can become infeasible.  Therefore, robot teams
  must be capable of dynamically splitting into smaller subteams and adaptively controlling
  the subteams to navigate through such scenarios while preserving formations. To
  enable this capability, we introduce a novel method for SubTeaming and Adaptive
  Formation (STAF), which is built upon a unified hierarchical learning framework:
  (1) high-level deep graph cut for team splitting, (2) intermediate-level graph learning
  for facilitating coordinated navigation among subteams,  and (3) low-level policy
  learning for controlling individual mobile robots to reach their goal positions
  while avoiding collisions. To evaluate STAF, we conducted extensive experiments
  in both indoor and outdoor environments using robotics simulations and physical
  robot teams. Experimental results show that STAF enables the novel capability for
  subteaming and adaptive formation control, and achieves promising performance in
  coordinated multi-robot navigation through challenging scenarios. More details are
  available on the project website: https://anonymous188.github.io/STAF/.'

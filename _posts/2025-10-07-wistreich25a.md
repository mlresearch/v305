  Manipulation'
section: Oral

abstract: Human skin provides a rich tactile sensing stream, localizing intentional
  and unintentional contact events over a large and contoured region. Replicating
  these tactile sensing capabilities for dexterous robotic manipulation systems remains
  a longstanding challenge. In this work, we take a step towards this goal by introducing
  DexSkin. DexSkin is a soft, conformable capacitive electronic skin that enables
  sensitive, localized, and calibratable tactile sensing, and can be tailored to varying
  geometries. We demonstrate its efficacy for learning downstream robotic manipulation
  by sensorizing a pair of parallel jaw gripper fingers, providing tactile coverage
  across almost the entire finger surfaces. We empirically evaluate DexSkin’s capabilities
  in learning challenging manipulation tasks that require sensing coverage across
  the entire surface of the fingers, such as reorienting objects in hand and wrapping
  elastic bands around boxes, in a learning-from-demonstration framework. We then
  show that, critically for data-driven approaches, DexSkin can be calibrated to enable
  model transfer across sensor instances, and demonstrate its applicability to online
  reinforcement learning on real robots. Our results highlight DexSkin’s suitability
  and practicality for learning real-world, contact-rich manipulation.

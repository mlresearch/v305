section: Poster
openreview: BNdgT6GeC6
abstract: Legged robots have the potential to leverage obstacles to climb steep sand
  slopes. However, efficiently repositioning these obstacles to desired locations
  is challenging. Here we present DiffusiveGRAIN, a learning-based method that enables
  a multi-legged robot to strategically induce localized sand avalanches during locomotion
  and indirectly manipulate obstacles. We conducted 375 trials, systematically varying
  obstacle spacing, robot orientation, and leg actions in 75 of them. Results show
  that movement of closely-spaced obstacles exhibit significant interference, requiring
  joint modeling. In addition, different multi-leg excavation actions could cause
  distinct robot state changes, necessitating integrated planning of manipulation
  and locomotion. To address these challenges, DiffusiveGRAIN includes a diffusion-based
  environment predictor to capture multi-obstacle movements under granular flow interferences
  and a robot state predictor to estimate changes in robot state from multi-leg action
  patterns. Deployment experiments (90 trials) demonstrate that by integrating the
  environment and robot state predictors, the robot can autonomously plan its movements
  based on loco-manipulation goals, successfully shifting closely located rocks to
  desired locations in over 65% of trials. Our study showcases the potential for a
  locomoting robot to strategically manipulate obstacles to achieve improved mobility
  on challenging terrains.

title: Action-Free Reasoning for Policy Generalization
section: Poster
openreview: DzRNBBCP4R
abstract: 'End-to-end imitation learning offers a promising approach for training
  robot policies. However, generalizing to new settings—such as unseen scenes, tasks,
  and object instances—remains a significant challenge. Although large-scale robot
  demonstration datasets have shown potential for inducing generalization, they are
  resource-intensive to scale. In contrast, human video data is abundant and diverse,
  presenting an attractive alternative. Yet, these human-video datasets lack action
  labels, complicating their use in imitation learning. Existing methods attempt to
  extract grounded action representations (e.g., hand poses), but resulting policies
  struggle to bridge the embodiment gap between human and robot actions. We propose
  an alternative approach: leveraging language-based reasoning from human videos—essential
  for guiding robot actions—to train generalizable robot policies. Building on recent
  advances in reasoning-based policy architectures, we introduce Reasoning through
  Action-free Data (RAD). RAD learns from both robot demonstration data (with reasoning
  and action labels) and action-free human video data (with only reasoning labels).
  The robot data teaches the model to map reasoning to low-level actions, while the
  action-free data enhances reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we release a new
  dataset of 3,377 human-hand demonstrations compatible with the Bridge V2 benchmark.
  This dataset includes chain-of-thought reasoning annotations and hand-tracking data,
  and is aimed at facilitating future research on reasoning-driven robot learning.
  Our experiments demonstrate that RAD enables effective transfer across the embodiment
  gap, allowing robots to perform tasks seen only in action-free data. Furthermore,
  scaling up action-free reasoning data significantly improves policy performance
  and generalization to novel tasks. These results highlight the promise of reasoning-driven
  learning from action-free datasets for advancing generalizable robot control. See

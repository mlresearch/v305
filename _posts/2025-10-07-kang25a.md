title: 'Learning Impact-Rich Rotational Maneuvers via Centroidal Velocity Rewards
  and Sim-to-Real Techniques: A One-Leg Hopper Flip Case Study'
section: Poster

abstract: Dynamic rotational maneuvers, such as front flips, inherently involve large
  angular momentum generation and intense impact forces, presenting major challenges
  for reinforcement learning and sim-to-real transfer. In this work, we propose a
  general framework for learning and deploying impact-rich, rotation-intensive behaviors
  through centroidal velocity-based rewards and actuator-aware sim-to-real techniques.
  We identify that conventional link-level reward formulations fail to induce true
  whole-body rotation and introduce a centroidal angular velocity reward that accurately
  captures system-wide rotational dynamics. To bridge the sim-to-real gap under extreme
  conditions, we model motor operating regions (MOR) and apply transmission load regularization
  to ensure realistic torque commands and mechanical robustness. Using the one-leg
  hopper front flip as a representative case study, we demonstrate the first successful
  hardware realization of a full front flip. Our results highlight that incorporating
  centroidal dynamics and actuator constraints is critical for reliably executing
  highly dynamic motions.

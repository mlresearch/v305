title: "$\\pi_0.5$: a Vision-Language-Action Model with Open-World Generalization"
section: Oral
openreview: vlhoswksBO
abstract: In order for robots to be useful, they must perform practically relevant
  tasks in the real world, outside of the lab. While vision-language-action (VLA)
  models have demonstrated impressive results for end-to-end robot control, it remains
  an open question how far such models can generalize in the wild. We describe $\pi_{0.5}$,
  a new model based on $\pi_0$ that uses co-training on heterogeneous tasks to enable
  broad generalization. $\pi_{0.5}$ uses data from multiple robots, high-level semantic
  prediction, web data, and other sources to enable broadly generalizable real-world
  robotic manipulation. Our system uses a combination of co-training and hybrid multi-modal
  examples that combine image observations, language commands, object detections,
  semantic subtask prediction, and low-level actions. Our experiments show that this
  kind of knowledge transfer is essential for effective generalization, and we demonstrate
  for the first time that an end-to-end learning-enabled robotic system can perform
  long-horizon and dexterous manipulation skills, such as cleaning a kitchen or bedroom,
  in entirely new homes.

title: Learning Long-Horizon Robot Manipulation Skills via Privileged Action
section: Poster
openreview: yOWUy97hmd
abstract: Long-horizon contact-rich tasks are challenging to learn with reinforcement
  learning, due to ineffective exploration of high-dimensional state spaces with sparse
  rewards. The learning process often gets stuck in local optimum and demands task-specific
  reward fine-tuning for complex scenarios.  In this work, we propose a structured
  framework that leverages privileged actions with curriculum learning, enabling the
  policy to efficiently acquire long-horizon skills without relying on extensive reward
  engineering or reference trajectories. Specifically, we use privileged actions in
  simulation with a general training procedure that would be infeasible to implement
  in real-world scenarios. These privileges include relaxed constraints and virtual
  forces that enhance interaction and exploration with objects. Our results successfully
  achieve complex multi-stage long-horizon tasks that naturally combine non-prehensile
  manipulation with grasping to lift objects from non-graspable poses. We demonstrate
  generality by maintaining a parsimonious reward structure and showing convergence
  to diverse and robust behaviors across various environments. Our approach outperforms
  state-of-the-art methods in these tasks, converging to solutions where others fail.

title: 'ComposableNav: Instruction-Following Navigation in Dynamic Environments via
  Composable Diffusion'
section: Poster
openreview: FBsawSyYBM
abstract: 'This paper considers the problem of enabling robots to navigate dynamic
  environments while following instructions.  The challenge lies in the combinatorial
  nature of instruction specifications: each instruction can include multiple specifications,
  and the number of possible specification combinations grows exponentially as the
  robot’s skill set expands. For example, “overtake the pedestrian while staying on
  the right side of the road” consists of two specifications: *"overtake the pedestrian"*
  and *"walk on the right side of the road."* To tackle this challenge, we propose
  ComposableNav, based on the intuition that following an instruction involves independently
  satisfying its constituent specifications, each corresponding to a distinct motion
  primitive.  Using diffusion models, ComposableNav learns each primitive separately,
  then composes them in parallel at deployment time to satisfy novel combinations
  of specifications unseen in training.  Additionally, to avoid the onerous need for
  demonstrations of individual motion primitives, we propose a two-stage training
  procedure: (1) supervised pre-training to learn a base diffusion model for dynamic
  navigation, and (2) reinforcement learning fine-tuning that molds the base model
  into different motion primitives. Through simulation and real-world experiments,
  we show that ComposableNav enables robots to follow instructions by generating trajectories
  that satisfy diverse and unseen combinations of specifications, significantly outperforming
  both non-compositional VLM-based policies and costmap composing baselines.'

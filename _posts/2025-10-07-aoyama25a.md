title: 'Poke and Strike: Learning Task-Informed Exploration Policies'
section: Poster
openreview: SUqMCzslNH
abstract: In many dynamic robotic tasks, such as striking pucks into a goal outside
  the reachable workspace, the robot must first identify the relevant physical properties
  of the object for successful task execution, as it is unable to recover from failure
  or retry without human intervention. To address this challenge, we propose a task-informed
  exploration approach, based on reinforcement learning, that trains an exploration
  policy using rewards automatically generated from the sensitivity of a privileged
  task policy to errors in estimated properties. We also introduce an uncertainty-based
  mechanism to determine when to transition from exploration to task execution, ensuring
  sufficient property estimation accuracy with minimal exploration time. Our method
  achieves a 90% success rate on the striking task with an average exploration time
  under 1.2 secondsâ€”significantly outperforming baselines that achieve at most 40%
  success or require inefficient querying and retraining in a simulator at test time.
  Additionally, we demonstrate that our task-informed rewards capture the relative
  importance of physical properties in both the striking task and the classical CartPole
  example. Finally, we validate our approach by demonstrating its ability to identify
  object properties and adjust task execution in a physical setup using the KUKA iiwa
  robot arm.

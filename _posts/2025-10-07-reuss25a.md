title: 'FLOWER: Democratizing Generalist Robot Policies with Efficient Vision-Language-Flow
  Models'
section: Poster
openreview: JeppaebLRD
abstract: 'Developing efficient Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies is crucial for
  practical robotics deployment, yet current approaches face prohibitive computational
  costs and resource requirements. Existing diffusion-based VLA policies require multi-billion-parameter
  models and massive datasets to achieve strong performance. We tackle this efficiency
  challenge with two contributions: intermediate-modality fusion, which reallocates
  capacity to the diffusion head by pruning up to 50% of LLM layers, and action-specific
  Global-AdaLN conditioning, which cuts parameters by 20% through modular adaptation.
  We integrate these advances into a novel 950 M-parameter VLA called FLOWER. Pretrained
  in just 200 H100 GPU hours, FLOWER delivers a 25.9% improvement over state-of-the-art
  baselines across 190 tasks spanning ten simulation and real-world benchmarks and
  demonstrates robustness across diverse robotic embodiments. All code, pretrained
  weights, and training recipes are publicly released to democratize efficient VLA
  development.'

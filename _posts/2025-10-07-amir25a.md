title: 'ReCoDe: Reinforcement Learning-based Dynamic Constraint Design for Multi-Agent
  Coordination'
section: Poster
openreview: qTYD21Wpxb
abstract: Constraint-based optimization is a cornerstone of robotics, enabling the
  design of controllers that reliably encode task and safety requirements such as
  collision avoidance or formation adherence. However, handcrafted constraints can
  fail in multi-agent settings that demand complex coordination. We introduce ReCoDe—Reinforcement-based
  Constraint Design—a decentralized, hybrid framework that merges the reliability
  of optimization-based controllers with the adaptability of multi-agent reinforcement
  learning. Rather than discarding expert controllers, ReCoDe improves them by learning
  additional, dynamic constraints that capture subtler behaviors, for example, by
  constraining agent movements to prevent congestion in cluttered scenarios. Through
  local communication, agents collectively constrain their allowed actions to coordinate
  more effectively under changing conditions. In this work, we focus on applications
  of ReCoDe to multi-agent navigation tasks requiring intricate, context-based movements
  and consensus, where we show that it outperforms purely handcrafted controllers,
  other hybrid approaches, and standard MARL baselines. We give empirical (real robot)
  and theoretical evidence that retaining a user-defined controller, even when it
  is imperfect, is more efficient than learning from scratch, especially because ReCoDe
  can dynamically change the degree to which it relies on this controller.

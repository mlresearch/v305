title: 'ManipBench: Benchmarking Vision-Language Models for Low-Level Robot Manipulation'
section: Poster
openreview: MCC3MG2aRH
abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence
  and robotics due to their commonsense reasoning capabilities. In robotic manipulation,
  VLMs are used primarily as high-level planners, but recent work has also studied
  their lower-level reasoning ability, which refers to making decisions about precise
  robot movements. However, the community currently lacks a clear and common benchmark
  that can evaluate how well VLMs can aid low-level reasoning in robotics. Consequently,
  we propose a novel benchmark, ManipBench, to evaluate the low-level robot manipulation
  reasoning capabilities of VLMs across various dimensions, including how well they
  understand object-object interactions and deformable object manipulation. We extensively
  test 35 common and state-of-the-art VLM families on our benchmark, including variants
  to test different model sizes. The performance of VLMs significantly varies across
  tasks, and there is a strong correlation between this performance and trends in
  our real-world manipulation tasks. It also shows that there remains a significant
  gap between these models and human-level understanding.

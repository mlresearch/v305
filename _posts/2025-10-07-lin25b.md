title: Constraint-Preserving Data Generation for One-Shot Visuomotor Policy Generalization
section: Poster
openreview: KSKzA1mwKs
abstract: 'Large-scale demonstration data has powered key breakthroughs in robot manipulation,
  but collecting that data remains costly and time-consuming. To this end, we present
  Constraint-Preserving Data Generation (CP-Gen), a method that uses a single expert
  trajectory to generate robot demonstrations containing novel object geometries and
  poses. These generated demonstrations are used to train closed-loop visuomotor policies
  that transfer zero-shot to the real world. Similar to prior data-generation work
  focused on pose variations, CP-Gen first decomposes expert demonstrations into free-space
  motions and robot skills. Unlike prior work, we achieve geometry-aware data generation
  by formulating robot skills as keypoint-trajectory constraints: keypoints on the
  robot or grasped object must track a reference trajectory defined relative to a
  task-relevant object. To generate a new demonstration, CP-Gen samples pose and geometry
  transforms for each task-relevant object, then applies these transforms to the object
  and its associated keypoints or keypoint trajectories. We optimize robot joint configurations
  so that the keypoints on the robot or grasped object track the transformed keypoint
  trajectory, and then motion plan a collision-free path to the first optimized joint
  configuration. Using demonstrations generated by CP-Gen, we train visuomotor policies
  that generalize across variations in object geometries and poses. Experiments on
  16 simulation tasks and four real-world tasks, featuring multi-stage, non-prehensile
  and tight-tolerance manipulation, show that policies trained using our method achieve
  an average success rate of 77%, outperforming the best baseline which achieves an
  average success rate of 50%.'

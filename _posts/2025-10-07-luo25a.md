title: Leveraging Correlation Across Test Platforms for Variance-Reduced Metric Estimation
section: Poster
openreview: ejV8YHTpHR
abstract: Learning-based robotic systems demand rigorous validation to assure reliable
  performance, but extensive real-world testing is often prohibitively expensive and
  if conducted may still yield insufficient data for high-confidence guarantees. In
  this work, we introduce a general estimation framework that leverages *paired* data
  across test platforms, e.g., paired simulation and real-world observations, to achieve
  better estimates of real-world metrics via the method of control variates. By incorporating
  cheap and abundant auxiliary measurements (for example, simulator outputs) as control
  variates for costly real-world samples, our method provably reduces the variance
  of Monte Carlo estimates and thus requires significantly fewer real-world samples
  to attain a specified confidence bound on the mean performance. We provide theoretical
  analysis characterizing the variance and sample-efficiency improvement, and demonstrate
  empirically in autonomous driving and quadruped robotics settings that our approach
  achieves high-probability bounds with markedly reduced sample complexity. Our technique
  can lower the real-world testing burden for validating the performance of the stack,
  thereby enabling more efficient and cost-effective experimental evaluation of robotic
  systems.

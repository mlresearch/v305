section: Poster
openreview: GH9kURIRlx
abstract: Learning-based robotics research driven by data demands a new approach to
  robot hardware design—one that serves as both a platform for policy execution and
  a tool for embodied data collection. We introduce ToddlerBot, a low-cost, open-source
  humanoid robot platform designed for robotics and AI research. ToddlerBot enables
  seamless acquisition of high-quality simulation and real-world data. The plug-and-play
  zero-point calibration and transferable motor system identification ensure a high-fidelity
  digital twin and zero-shot sim-to-real policy transfer. A user-friendly teleoperation
  interface streamlines real-world data collection from human demonstrations. With
  its data collection ability and anthropomorphic design, ToddlerBot is ideal for
  whole-body loco-manipulation research. Additionally, ToddlerBot’s compact size (0.56
  m, 3.4 kg) ensures safe operation in real-world environments. Reproducibility is
  achieved with entirely 3D-printed, open-source design and off-the-shelf components,
  keeping the total cost under 6,000 USD. This allows assembly and maintenance with
  basic technical expertise, as validated by successful independent replications of
  the system. We demonstrate ToddlerBot’s capabilities through arm span, payload,
  endurance tests, loco-manipulation tasks, and a collaborative long-horizon scenario
  where two robots tidy a toy session together. By advancing ML-compatibility, capability,
  and reproducibility, ToddlerBot provides a robust and scalable platform for policy
  learning and execution in robotics research.

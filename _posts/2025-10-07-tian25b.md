title: 'O$^3$Afford: One-Shot 3D Object-to-Object Affordance Grounding for Generalizable
  Robotic Manipulation'
section: Poster
openreview: rJRFFDVTnf
abstract: Grounding object affordance is fundamental to robotic manipulation as it
  establishes the critical link between perception and action among interacting objects.
  However, prior works predominantly focus on predicting single-object affordance,
  overlooking the fact that most real-world interactions involve relationships between
  pairs of objects. In this work, we address the challenge of object-to-object affordance
  grounding under limited data. Inspired by recent advances in few-shot learning with
  2D vision foundation models, we propose a novel one-shot 3D object-to-object affordance
  learning approach for robotic manipulation. Semantic features from vision foundation
  models combined with point cloud representation for geometric understanding enable
  our one-shot learning pipeline to generalize effectively to novel objects and categories.
  We further integrate our 3D affordance representation with large language models
  (LLMs) for optimization-based motion planning, significantly enhancing LLMsâ€™ capability
  to comprehend and reason about object interactions when generating task-specific
  constraint functions. Our experiments on 3D object-to-object affordance grounding
  and robotic manipulation demonstrate that our O$^3$Afford significantly outperforms
  existing baselines in terms of both accuracy and generalization capability.

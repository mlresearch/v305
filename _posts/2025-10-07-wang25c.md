  Policies'

abstract: 'Robotic manipulation tasks involving cutting deformable objects remain
  challenging due to complex topological behaviors, difficulties in perceiving dense
  object states, and the lack of efficient evaluation methods for cutting outcomes.
  In this paper, we introduce TopoCut, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step robotic
  cutting tasks that integrates a cutting environment and generalized policy learning.
  TopoCut is built upon three core components: (1) a high-fidelity simulation environment
  based on a particle-based elastoplastic solver with compliant von Mises constitutive
  models, augmented by a novel damage-driven topology discovery mechanism for accurate
  tracking of multiple cutting pieces; (2) a comprehensive reward design that combines
  this topology discovery with a pose-invariant spectral reward model based on Laplace–Beltrami
  eigenanalysis, enabling consistent and robust assessment of cutting quality; and
  (3) an integrated policy learning pipeline, where a dynamics-informed perception
  module predicts topological evolution and produces particle-wise, topology-aware
  embeddings to support PDDP—Particle-based Score-Entropy Discrete Diffusion Policy—for
  goal-conditioned policy learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TopoCut
  enables trajectory generation, scalable learning, precise evaluation, and strong
  generalization across diverse object geometries, scales, poses, and cutting goals.'

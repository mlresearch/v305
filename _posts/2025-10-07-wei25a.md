title: Ensuring Force Safety in Vision-Guided Robotic Manipulation via Implicit Tactile
  Calibration
section: Poster
openreview: yeuA6M8JIX
abstract: In unstructured environments, robotic manipulation tasks involving objects
  with constrained motion trajectories—such as door opening—often experience discrepancies
  between the robot’s vision-guided end-effector trajectory and the object’s constrained
  motion path.  Such discrepancies generate unintended harmful forces, which, if exacerbated,
  may lead to task failure and potential damage to the manipulated objects or the
  robot itself. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel diffusion framework,
  termed SafeDiff. Unlike conventional methods that sequentially fuse visual and tactile
  data to predict future robot states, our approach generates a prospective state
  sequence based on the current robot state and visual context observations, using
  real-time force feedback as a calibration signal.  This implicitly adjusts the robot’s
  state within the state space, enhancing operational success rates and significantly
  reducing harmful forces during manipulation, thus ensuring manipulation force safety.
  Additionally, we develop a large-scale simulation dataset named SafeDoorManip50k,
  offering extensive multimodal data to train and evaluate the proposed method. Extensive
  experiments show that our visual-tactile model substantially mitigates the risk
  of harmful forces in the door opening task, across both simulated and real-world
  settings.

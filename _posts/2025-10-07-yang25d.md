title: 'Deep Reactive Policy: Learning Reactive Manipulator Motion Planning for Dynamic
  Environments'
section: Poster
openreview: 4eSv0QeYlz
abstract: Generating collision-free motion in dynamic, partially observable environments
  is a fundamental challenge for robotic manipulators. Classical motion planners can
  compute globally optimal trajectories but require full environment knowledge and
  are typically too slow for dynamic scenes. Neural motion policies offer a promising
  alternative by operating in closed-loop directly on raw sensory inputs but often
  struggle to generalize in complex or dynamic settings. We propose Deep Reactive
  Policy (DRP), a visuo-motor neural motion policy designed for reactive motion generation
  in diverse dynamic environments, operating directly on point cloud sensory input.
  At its core is IMPACT, a transformer-based neural motion policy pretrained on 10
  million generated expert trajectories across diverse simulation scenarios. We further
  improve IMPACT’s static obstacle avoidance through iterative student-teacher finetuning.
  We additionally enhance the policy’s dynamic obstacle avoidance at inference time
  using DCP-RMP, a locally reactive goal-proposal module. We evaluate DRP on challenging
  tasks featuring cluttered scenes, dynamic moving obstacles, and goal obstructions.
  DRP achieves strong generalization, outperforming prior classical and neural methods
  in success rate across both simulated and real-world settings. We will release the
  dataset, simulation environments, and trained models upon acceptance. Refer to supplementary
  material for videos.

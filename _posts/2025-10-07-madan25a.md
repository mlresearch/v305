title: 'PrioriTouch: Adapting to User Contact Preferences for Whole-Arm Physical Human-Robot
  Interaction'
section: Poster
openreview: sA2Yv4QKMr
abstract: Many robot caregiving tasks, such as bathing, dressing, and transferring,
  require a robot arm to make contact with a human body at multiple points rather
  than solely at the end effector. However, varied human touch preferences can lead
  to unsafe or uncomfortable multi-contact interactions. To address this, we introduce
  PrioriTouch, a framework integrating a novel contextual bandit algorithm with hierarchical
  operational space control to learn user contact preferences and translate them into
  low-level pose and force control policies. PrioriTouch minimizes user discomfort
  by initially gathering real-world feedback and subsequently refining the policy
  using simulation-in-the-loop, thus avoiding unsafe user experimentation. Guided
  by insights from a user study on physical assistance preferences, we rigorously
  evaluate PrioriTouch in extensive simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating
  effective adaptation to user contact preferences, maintained task performance, and
  enhanced safety and comfort.

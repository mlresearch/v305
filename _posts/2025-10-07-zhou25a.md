title: 'AutoEval: Autonomous Evaluation of Generalist Robot Manipulation Policies
  in the Real World'
section: Poster
openreview: isrcFrgwZp
abstract: 'Scalable and reproducible policy evaluation has been a long-standing challenge
  in robot learning: evaluations are critical to assess progress and build better
  policies, but evaluation in the real world, especially at a scale that would provide
  statistically reliable results, is costly in terms of human time and hard to obtain.
  Evaluation of increasingly generalist robot policies requires an increasingly diverse
  repertoire of evaluation environments, making the evaluation bottleneck even more
  pronounced. To make real-world evaluation of robotic policies more practical, we
  propose AutoEval, a system to autonomously evaluate generalist robot policies around
  the clock with minimal human intervention. Users interact with AutoEval by submitting
  evaluation jobs to the AutoEval queue, much like how software jobs are submitted
  with a cluster scheduling system, and AutoEval will schedule the policies for evaluation
  within a framework supplying automatic success detection and automatic scene resets.
  We show that AutoEval can nearly fully eliminate human involvement in the evaluation
  process, permitting around the clock evaluations, and the evaluation results correspond
  closely to ground truth evaluations conducted by hand. To facilitate the evaluation
  of generalist policies in the robotics community, we provide public access to multiple
  AutoEval scenes in the popular BridgeData robot setup with WidowX robot arms. In
  the future, we hope that AutoEval scenes can be set up across institutions to form
  a diverse and distributed evaluation network.'

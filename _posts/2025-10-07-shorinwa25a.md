title: 'SIREN: Semantic, Initialization-Free Registration of Multi-Robot Gaussian
  Splatting Maps'
section: Poster
openreview: JEGOuknVml
abstract: We present SIREN for registration of multi-robot Gaussian Splatting (GSplat)
  maps, with zero access to camera poses, images, and inter-map transforms for initialization
  or fusion of local submaps. To realize these capabilities, SIREN harnesses the versatility
  and robustness of semantics in three critical ways to derive a rigorous registration
  pipeline for multi-robot GSplat maps. First, SIREN utilizes semantics to identify
  feature-rich regions of the local maps where the registration problem is better
  posed, eliminating the need for any initialization which is generally required in
  prior work. Second, SIREN identifies candidate correspondences between Gaussians
  in the local maps using robust semantic features, constituting the foundation for
  robust geometric optimization, coarsely aligning 3D Gaussian primitives extracted
  from the local maps. Third, this key step enables subsequent photometric refinement
  of the transformation between the submaps, where SIREN leverages novel-view synthesis
  in GSplat maps along with a semantics-based image filter to compute a high-accuracy
  non-rigid transformation for the generation of a high-fidelity fused map. We demonstrate
  the superior performance of SIREN compared to competing baselines across a range
  of real-world datasets, and in particular, across the most widely used robot hardware
  platforms, including a manipulator, drone, and quadruped.  In fact, in the most
  challenging scenes where accurate feature matching is extremely challenging, SIREN
  achieves about 90x smaller rotation errors, 300x smaller translation errors, and
  44x smaller scale errors, compared to competing methods. We will release the code
  and provide a link to the project page after the review process.

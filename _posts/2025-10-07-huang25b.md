  Fine-Tuning'

openreview: bOVF8Rj33i
abstract: Humans excel at bimanual assembly tasks by adapting to rich tactile feedback—a
  capability that remains difficult to replicate in robots through behavioral cloning
  alone, due to the suboptimality and limited diversity of human demonstrations. In
  this work, we present VT-Refine, a visuo-tactile policy learning framework that
  combines real-world demonstrations, high-fidelity tactile simulation, and reinforcement
  learning to tackle precise, contact-rich bimanual assembly. We begin by training
  a diffusion policy on a small set of demonstrations using synchronized visual and
  tactile inputs. This policy is then transferred to a simulated digital twin equipped
  with simulated tactile sensors and further refined via large-scale reinforcement
  learning to enhance robustness and generalization. To enable accurate sim-to-real
  transfer, we leverage high-resolution piezoresistive tactile sensors that provide
  normal force signals and can be realistically modeled in parallel using GPU-accelerated
  simulation. Experimental results show that VT-Refine improves assembly performance
  in both simulation and the real world by increasing data diversity and enabling
  more effective policy fine-tuning. Our project page is available at https://vt-refine.github.io/

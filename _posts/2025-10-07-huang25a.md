title: 'LaDi-WM: A Latent Diffusion-Based World Model for Predictive Manipulation'
section: Poster
openreview: o2w2iiMyEU
abstract: Predictive manipulation has recently gained considerable attention in the
  Embodied AI community due to its potential to improve robot policy performance by
  leveraging predicted states. However, generating accurate future visual states of
  robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly
  in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM,
  a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling.
  Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained
  Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based)
  and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the
  latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting
  pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively
  refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more
  consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
  benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by
  27.9% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore,
  our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.

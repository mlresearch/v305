title: 'ScrewSplat: An End-to-End Method for Articulated Object Recognition'
section: Oral
openreview: gD6YV5OuW3
abstract: Articulated object recognition – the task of identifying both the geometry
  and kinematic joints of objects with movable parts – is essential for enabling robots
  to interact with everyday objects such as doors and laptops. However, existing approaches
  often rely on strong assumptions, such as a known number of articulated parts; require
  additional inputs, such as depth images; or involve complex intermediate steps that
  can introduce potential errors – limiting their practicality in real-world settings.
  In this paper, we introduce **ScrewSplat**, a simple end-to-end method that operates
  solely on RGB observations. Our approach begins by randomly initializing screw axes,
  which are then iteratively optimized to recover the object’s underlying kinematic
  structure. By integrating with Gaussian Splatting, we simultaneously reconstruct
  the 3D geometry and segment the object into rigid, movable parts. We demonstrate
  that our method achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy across a diverse
  set of articulated objects, and further enables zero-shot, text-guided manipulation
  using the recovered kinematic model.

title: 'HuB: Learning Extreme Humanoid Balance'
section: Oral
openreview: FCpYuGtN4j
abstract: 'The human body demonstrates exceptional motor capabilities—such as standing
  steadily on one foot or performing a high kick with the leg raised over 1.5 meters—both
  requiring precise balance control. While recent research on humanoid control has
  leveraged reinforcement learning to track human motions for skill acquisition, applying
  this paradigm to balance-intensive tasks remains challenging. In this work, we identify
  three key obstacles: instability from reference motion errors, learning difficulties
  due to morphological mismatch, and the sim-to-real gap caused by sensor noise and
  unmodeled dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{HuB}$ ($\textbf{Hu}$manoid
  $\textbf{B}$alance), a unified framework that integrates $\textit{reference motion
  refinement}$, $\textit{balance-aware policy learning}$, and $\textit{sim-to-real
  robustness training}$, with each component targeting a specific challenge. We validate
  our approach on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot across challenging quasi-static balance
  tasks, including extreme single-legged poses such as $\texttt{Swallow Balance}$
  and $\texttt{Bruce Lee’s Kick}$. Our policy remains stable even under strong physical
  disturbances—such as a forceful soccer strike—while baseline methods consistently
  fail to complete these tasks.'

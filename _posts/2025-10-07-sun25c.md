title: 'HyperTASR: Hypernetwork-Driven Task-Aware Scene Representations for Robust
  Manipulation'
section: Poster
openreview: BcJlmjF1vV
abstract: Effective policy learning for robotic manipulation requires scene representations
  that selectively capture task-relevant environmental features. Current approaches
  typically employ task-agnostic representation extraction, failing to emulate the
  dynamic perceptual adaptation observed in human cognition. We present HyperTASR,
  a hypernetwork-driven framework that modulates scene representations based on both
  task objectives and the execution phase. Our architecture dynamically generates
  representation transformation parameters conditioned on task specifications and
  progression state, enabling representations to evolve contextually throughout task
  execution. This approach maintains architectural compatibility with existing policy
  learning frameworks while fundamentally reconfiguring how visual features are processed.
  Unlike methods that simply concatenate or fuse task embeddings with task-agnostic
  representations, HyperTASR establishes computational separation between task-contextual
  and state-dependent processing paths, enhancing learning efficiency and representational
  quality. Comprehensive evaluations in both simulation and real-world environments
  demonstrate substantial performance improvements across different representation
  paradigms. Most notably, HyperTASR elevates success rates by over 27% when applied
  to GNFactor and achieves unprecedented single-view performance exceeding 80% success
  with 3D Diffuser Actor. Through ablation studies and attention visualization, we
  confirm that our approach selectively prioritizes task-relevant scene information,
  closely mirroring human adaptive perception during manipulation tasks.

title: 'DemoSpeedup: Accelerating Visuomotor Policies via Entropy-Guided Demonstration
  Acceleration'
section: Oral
openreview: Tl7girqoLi
abstract: Imitation learning has shown great promise in robotic manipulation, but
  the policyâ€™s execution is often unsatisfactorily slow due to commonly tardy demonstrations
  collected by human operators. In this work, we present DemoSpeedup, a self-supervised
  method to accelerate visuomotor policy execution via entropy-guided demonstration
  acceleration. DemoSpeedup starts from training an arbitrary generative policy (e.g.,
  ACT or Diffusion Policy) on normal-speed demonstrations, which serves as a per-frame
  action entropy estimator. The key insight is that frames with lower action entropy
  estimates call for more consistent policy behaviors, which often indicate the demands
  for higher-precision operations. In contrast, frames with higher entropy estimates
  correspond to more casual sections, and therefore can be more safely accelerated.
  Thus, we segment the original demonstrations according to the estimated entropy,
  and accelerate them by down-sampling at rates that increase with the entropy values.
  Trained with the speedup demonstrations, the resulting policies execute up to 3
  times faster while maintaining the task completion performance. Interestingly, these
  policies could even achieve higher success rates than those trained with normal-speed
  demonstrations, due to the benefits of reduced decision-making horizons.

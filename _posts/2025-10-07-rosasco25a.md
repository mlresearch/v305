title: 'KDPE: A Kernel Density Estimation Strategy for Diffusion Policy Trajectory
  Selection'
section: Poster
openreview: w0zDVjLscj
abstract: Learning robot policies that capture multimodality in the training data
  has been a long-standing open challenge for behavior cloning. Recent approaches
  tackle the problem by modeling the conditional action distribution with generative
  models. One of these approaches is Diffusion Policy, which relies on a diffusion
  model to denoise random points into robot action trajectories. While achieving state-of-the-art
  performance, it has two main drawbacks that may lead the robot out of the data distribution
  during policy execution. First, the stochasticity of the denoising process can highly
  impact on the quality of generated trajectory of actions. Second, being a supervised
  learning approach, it can learn data outliers from the dataset used for training.
  Recent work focuses on mitigating these limitations by combining Diffusion Policy
  either with large-scale training or with classical behavior cloning algorithms.
  Instead, we propose KDPE, a Kernel Density Estimation-based strategy that filters
  out potentially harmful trajectories output of Diffusion Policy while keeping a
  low test-time computational overhead. For Kernel Density Estimation, we propose
  a manifold-aware kernel to model a probability density function for actions composed
  of end-effector Cartesian position, orientation, and gripper state. KDPE overall
  achieves better performance than Diffusion Policy on simulated single-arm RoboMimic
  and MimicGen tasks, and on three real robot experiments:PickPlush, a tabletop grasping
  task, CubeSort, a multimodal pick and place task, and CoffeeMaking, a task that
  requires long-horizon capabilities and precise execution. The code will be released
  upon acceptance and additional material is provided on our anonymized project page:https://kdpe-robotics.github.io.

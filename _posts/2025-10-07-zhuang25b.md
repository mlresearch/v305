title: 'Embrace Contacts: humanoid shadowing with full body ground contacts'
section: Poster
openreview: JibqR9sEdW
abstract: 'Previous humanoid robot research works treat the robot as a bipedal mobile
  manipulation platform, where only the feet and hands contact the environment. However,
  we humans use all body parts to interact with the world, e.g., we sit in chairs,
  get up from the ground, or roll on the floor. Contacting the environment using body
  parts other than feet and hands brings significant challenges in both model-predictive
  control and reinforcement learning-based methods: an unpredictable contact sequence
  makes it almost impossible for model-predictive control to plan ahead in real time;
  the success of sim-to-real reinforcement learning for humanoids heavily depends
  on the acceleration of the rigid-body physical simulator and the simplification
  of collision detection. On the other hand, lacking extreme torso movement of humanoid
  data makes all other components non-trivial to design, such as dataset distribution,
  motion commands, and task rewards. To address these challenges, we propose a general
  humanoid motion framework that takes discrete motion commands and controls the robotâ€™s
  motor actions in real time. Using a GPU-accelerated simulator, we train a humanoid
  whole-body control policy that follows the high-level motion command in the real
  world in real time, even with stochastic contacts and extremely large robot base
  rotation and not-so-feasible motion commands.'

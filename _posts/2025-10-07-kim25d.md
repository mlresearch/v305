title: 'UniSkill: Imitating Human Videos via Cross-Embodiment Skill Representations'
section: Poster
openreview: EgSDP6AOF1
abstract: Mimicry is a fundamental learning mechanism in humans, enabling individuals
  to learn new tasks by observing and imitating experts. However, applying this ability
  to robots presents significant challenges due to the inherent differences between
  human and robot embodiments in both their visual appearance and physical capabilities.
  While previous methods bridge this gap using cross-embodiment datasets with shared
  scenes and tasks, collecting such aligned data between humans and robots at scale
  is not trivial. In this paper, we propose UniSkill, a novel framework that learns
  embodiment-agnostic skill representations from large-scale cross-embodiment video
  data without any labels, enabling skills extracted from human video prompts to effectively
  transfer to robot policies trained only on robot data. Our experiments in both simulation
  and real-world environments show that our cross-embodiment skills successfully guide
  robots in selecting appropriate actions, even with unseen video prompts.

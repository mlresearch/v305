title: 'Text2Touch: Tactile In-Hand Manipulation with LLM-Designed Reward Functions'
section: Poster
openreview: U9zcbQVDGa
abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are beginning to automate reward design for
  dexterous manipulation. However, no prior work has considered tactile sensing, which
  is known to be critical for human-like dexterity. We present Text2Touch, bringing
  LLM-crafted rewards to the challenging task of multi-axis in-hand object rotation
  with real-world vision based tactile sensing in palm-up and palm-down configurations.
  Our prompt engineering strategy scales to over 70 environment variables, and sim-to-real
  distillation enables successful policy transfer to a tactile-enabled fully actuated
  four-fingered dexterous robot hand. Text2Touch significantly outperforms a carefully
  tuned human-engineered baseline, demonstrating superior rotation speed and stability
  while relying on reward functions that are an order of magnitude shorter and simpler.
  These results illustrate how LLM-designed rewards can significantly reduce the time
  from concept to deployable dexterous tactile skills, supporting more rapid and scalable
  multimodal robot learning.

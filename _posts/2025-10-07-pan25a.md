title: 'One Demo is Worth a Thousand Trajectories: Action-View Augmentation for Visuomotor
  Policies'
section: Poster
openreview: Hu3NoPMAg4
abstract: Visuomotor policies for manipulation have demonstrated remarkable potential
  in modeling complex robotic behaviors, yet minor alterations in the robotâ€™s initial
  configuration and unseen obstacles easily lead to out-of-distribution observations.
  Without extensive data collection effort, these result in catastrophic execution
  failures. In this work, we introduce an effective data augmentation framework that
  generates visually realistic fisheye image sequences and corresponding physically
  feasible action trajectories from real-world eye-in-hand demonstrations, captured
  with a portable parallel gripper with a single fisheye camera. We introduce a novel
  Gaussian Splatting formulation, adapted to wide FoV fisheye cameras, to reconstruct
  and edit the 3D scene with unseen objects. We utilize trajectory optimization to
  generate smooth, collision-free, view-rendering-friendly action trajectories and
  render visual observations from corresponding novel views. Comprehensive experiments
  in simulation and the real world show that our augmentation framework improves the
  success rate for various manipulation tasks in both the same scene and the augmented
  scene with obstacles requiring collision avoidance.

  Hardware'
section: Oral
openreview: VVhAhzr2WV
abstract: Scaling robot learning requires vast and diverse datasets. Yet the prevailing
  data collection paradigm—human teleoperation—remains costly and constrained by manual
  effort and physical robot access. We introduce Real2Render2Real (R2R2R), a novel
  approach for generating robot training data without relying on object dynamics simulation
  or teleoperation of robot hardware. The input is a smartphone-captured scan of one
  or more objects and a single video of a human demonstration. R2R2R renders thousands
  of high visual fidelity robot-agnostic demonstrations by reconstructing detailed
  3D object geometry and appearance, and tracking 6-DoF object motion. R2R2R uses
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to enable flexible asset generation and trajectory
  synthesis for both rigid and articulated objects, converting these representations
  to meshes to maintain compatibility with scalable rendering engines like IsaacLab
  but with collision-modeling turned off. Robot demonstration data generated by R2R2R
  integrates directly with models that operate on robot proprioceptive states and
  image observations, such as vision-language-action models (VLA) and imitation learning
  policies. Physical experiments suggest that models trained on R2R2R data from a
  single human demonstration can match the performance of models trained on 150 human
  teleoperation demonstrations.

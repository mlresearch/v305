title: 'exUMI: Extensible Robot Teaching System with Action-aware Task-agnostic Tactile
  Representation'
section: Poster
openreview: b86nyIOJWq
abstract: Tactile-aware robot learning faces critical challenges in data collection
  and representation due to data scarcity and sparsity, and the absence of force feedback
  in existing systems. To address these limitations, we introduce a tactile robot
  learning system with both hardware and algorithm innovations. We present exUMI,
  an extensible data collection device that enhances the vanilla UMI with robust proprioception
  (via AR MoCap and rotary encoder), modular visuo-tactile sensing, and automated
  calibration, achieving 100% data usability. Building on an efficient collection
  of over 1 M tactile frames, we propose Tactile Prediction Pretraining (TPP), a representation
  learning framework through action-aware temporal tactile prediction, capturing contact
  dynamics and mitigates tactile sparsity. Real-world experiments show that TPP outperforms
  traditional tactile imitation learning. Our work bridges the gap between human tactile
  intuition and robot learning through co-designed hardware and algorithms, offering
  open-source resources to advance contact-rich manipulation research.

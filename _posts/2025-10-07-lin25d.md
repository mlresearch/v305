title: 'TypeTele: Releasing Dexterity in Teleoperation by Dexterous Manipulation Types'
section: Poster
openreview: 7OOMC7pzaw
abstract: Dexterous teleoperation plays a crucial role in robotic manipulation for
  real-world data collection and remote robot control. Previous dexterous teleoperation
  mostly relies on hand retargeting to closely mimic human hand postures. However,
  these approaches may fail to fully leverage the inherent dexterity of dexterous
  hands, which can execute unique actions through their structural advantages compared
  to human hands. To address this limitation, we propose TypeTele, a type-guided dexterous
  teleoperation system, which enables dexterous hands to perform actions that are
  not constrained by human motion patterns. This is achieved by introducing dexterous
  manipulation types into the teleoperation system, allowing operators to employ appropriate
  types to complete specific tasks. To support this system, we build an extensible
  dexterous manipulation type library to cover comprehensive dexterous postures used
  in manipulation tasks. During teleoperation, we employ a MLLM (Multi-modality Large
  Language Model)-assisted type retrieval module to identify the most suitable manipulation
  type based on the specific task and operator commands. Extensive experiments of
  real-world teleoperation and imitation learning demonstrate that the incorporation
  of manipulation types significantly takes full advantage of the dexterous robotâ€™s
  ability to perform diverse and complex tasks with higher success rates.

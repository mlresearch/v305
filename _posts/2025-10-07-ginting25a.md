  Question Answering'

abstract: As robots become increasingly capable of operating over extended periods—spanning
  days, weeks, and even months—they are expected to accumulate knowledge of their
  environments and leverage this experience to assist humans more effectively. This
  paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied Question Answering (LA-EQA),
  a new task in which a robot must both recall past experiences and actively explore
  its environment to answer complex, temporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional
  EQA settings, which typically focus either on understanding the present environment
  alone or on recalling a single past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason
  over past, present, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to
  consult its memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final
  answer. Standard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due
  to limited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to combine
  memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a structured
  memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from cognitive science.
  Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based world instances, forming
  a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables targeted memory retrieval and guided
  navigation. To balance the exploration-recall trade-off, we introduce value-of-information-based
  stopping criteria that determines when the agent has gathered sufficient information.
  We evaluate our method on real-world experiments and introduce a new benchmark that
  spans popular simulation environments and actual industrial sites. Our approach
  significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding substantial gains
  in both answer accuracy and exploration efficiency.

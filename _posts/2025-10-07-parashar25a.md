title: Cost-aware Discovery of Contextual Failures using Bayesian Active Learning
section: Poster
openreview: f2Y549UzM5
abstract: Ensuring the robustness of robotic systems is crucial for their deployment
  in safety-critical domains. Failure discovery, or falsification, is a widely used
  approach for evaluating robustness, with recent advancements focusing on improving
  sample efficiency and generalization through probabilistic sampling techniques and
  learning-theoretic approaches. However, existing methods typically rely on explicitly
  defined analytical cost functions to characterize failures, often overlooking the
  underlying causes and diversity of discovered failure scenarios. In this work, we
  propose a novel failure discovery framework that integrates contextual reasoning
  in the falsification process, specifically tailored for high evaluation-cost applications.
  Our method incorporates expert-in-the-loop feedback to construct a probabilistic
  surrogate model of failures using Bayesian inference. This model is iteratively
  refined and leveraged to guide an active learning strategy that prioritizes the
  discovery of diverse failure cases. We empirically validate our approach across
  a range of tasks for high-cost contextual falsification in robotic manipulation
  and autonomous driving.

title: LLM-Guided Probabilistic Program Induction for POMDP Model Estimation
section: Poster
openreview: R5Y7Sr1DIe
abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) model decision making
  under uncertainty. While there are many approaches to approximately solving POMDPs,
  we aim to address the problem of learning such models. In particular, we are interested
  in a subclass of POMDPs wherein the components of the model, including the observation
  function, reward function, transition function, and initial state distribution function,
  can be modeled as low-complexity probabilistic graphical models in the form of a
  short probabilistic program. Our strategy to learn these programs uses an LLM as
  a prior, generating candidate probabilistic programs that are then tested against
  the empirical distribution and adjusted through feedback. We experiment on a number
  of classical toy POMDP problems, simulated MiniGrid domains, and two real mobile-base
  robotics search domains involving partial observability. Our results show that using
  an LLM to guide in the construction of a low-complexity POMDP model can be more
  effective than tabular POMDP learning, behavior cloning, or direct LLM planning.

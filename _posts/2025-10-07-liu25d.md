  Language Models'

abstract: Assistive teleoperation, where control is shared between a human and a robot,
  enables efficient and intuitive human-robot collaboration in diverse and unstructured
  environments. A central challenge in real-world assistive teleoperation is for the
  robot to infer a wide range of human intentions from user control inputs and to
  assist users with correct actions. Existing methods are either confined to simple,
  predefined scenarios or restricted to task-specific data distributions at training,
  limiting their support for real-world assistance. We introduce Casper, an assistive
  teleoperation system that leverages commonsense knowledge embedded in pre-trained
  visual language models (VLMs) for real-time intent inference and flexible skill
  execution. Casper incorporates an open-world perception module for a generalized
  understanding of novel objects and scenes, a VLM-powered intent inference mechanism
  that leverages commonsense reasoning to interpret snippets of teleoperated user
  input, and a skill library that expands the scope of prior assistive teleoperation
  systems to support diverse, long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks. Extensive empirical
  evaluation, including human studies and system ablations, demonstrates that Casper
  improves task performance, reduces human cognitive load, and achieves higher user
  satisfaction than direct teleoperation and assistive teleoperation baselines. More

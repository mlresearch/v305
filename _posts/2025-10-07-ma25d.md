title: Bipedal Balance Control with Whole-body Musculoskeletal Standing and Falling
  Simulations
section: Poster
openreview: AVDCwK1dek
abstract: Balance control is important for human and bipedal robotic systems. While
  dynamic balance during locomotion has received considerable attention, quantitative
  understanding of static balance and falling remains limited. This work presents
  a hierarchical control pipeline for simulating human balance via a comprehensive
  whole-body musculoskeletal system. We identified spatiotemporal dynamics of balancing
  during stable standing, revealed the impact of muscle injury on balancing behavior,
  and generated fall contact patterns that aligned with clinical data. Furthermore,
  our simulated hip exoskeleton assistance demonstrated improvement in balance maintenance
  and reduced muscle effort under perturbation. This work offers unique muscle-level
  insights into human balance dynamics that are challenging to capture experimentally.
  It could provide a foundation for developing targeted interventions for individuals
  with balance impairments and support the advancement of humanoid robotic systems.

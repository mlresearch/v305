title: Capability-Aware Shared Hypernetworks for Flexible Heterogeneous Multi-Robot
  Coordination
section: Poster
openreview: qoKo2caB9B
abstract: Recent advances have enabled heterogeneous multi-robot teams to learn complex
  and effective coordination skills.  However, existing neural architectures that
  support heterogeneous teaming tend to force a trade-off between expressivity and
  efficiency. Shared-parameter designs prioritize sample efficiency by enabling a
  single network to be shared across all or a pre-specified subset of robots (via
  input augmentations), but tend to limit behavioral diversity. In contrast, recent
  designs employ a separate policy for each robot, enabling greater diversity and
  expressivity at the cost of efficiency and generalization. Our key insight is that
  such tradeoffs can be avoided by viewing these design choices as ends of a broad
  spectrum. Inspired by recent work in transfer and meta learning, and building on
  prior work in multi-robot task allocation, we propose Capability-Aware Shared Hypernetworks
  (CASH), a *soft weight sharing* architecture that uses hypernetworks to efficiently
  learn a *flexible* shared policy that dynamically adapts to each robot post-training.
  By explicitly encoding the impact of robot capabilities (e.g., speed and payload)
  on collective behavior, CASH enables *zero-shot generalization* to unseen robots
  or team compositions. Our experiments involve multiple heterogeneous tasks, three
  learning paradigms (imitation learning, value-based, and policy-gradient RL), and
  SOTA multi-robot simulation (JaxMARL) and hardware (Robotarium) platforms. Across
  all conditions, we find that CASH generates appropriately-diverse behaviors and
  consistently outperforms baseline architectures in terms of performance and sample
  efficiency during both training and zero-shot generalization, all with 60%-80% fewer
  learnable parameters.

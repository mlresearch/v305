title: Sequence Modeling for Time-Optimal Quadrotor Trajectory Optimization with Sampling-based
  Robustness Analysis
section: Poster
openreview: rbMoMEK4m2
abstract: Time-optimal trajectories drive quadrotors to their dynamic limits, but
  computing such trajectories involves solving non-convex problems via iterative nonlinear
  optimization, making them prohibitively costly for real-time applications. In this
  work, we investigate learning-based models that imitate a model-based time-optimal
  trajectory planner to accelerate trajectory generation. Given a dataset of collision-free
  geometric paths, we show that modeling architectures can effectively learn the patterns
  underlying time-optimal trajectories. We introduce a quantitative framework to analyze
  local analytic properties of the learned models and link them to the Backward Reachable
  Tube of the geometric tracking controller. To enhance robustness, we propose a data
  augmentation scheme that applies random perturbations to the input paths. Compared
  to classical planners, our method achieves substantial speedups, and we validate
  its real-time feasibility on a hardware quadrotor platform. Experiments demonstrate
  that the learned models generalize to previously unseen path lengths.

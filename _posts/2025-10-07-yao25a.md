title: Towards Generalizable Safety in Crowd Navigation via Conformal Uncertainty
  Handling
section: Poster
openreview: FdgtV9mO6j
abstract: Mobile robots navigating in crowds trained using reinforcement learning
  are known to suffer performance degradation when faced with out-of-distribution
  scenarios. We propose that by properly accounting for the uncertainties of pedestrians,
  a robot can learn safe navigation policies that are robust to distribution shifts.
  Our method augments agent observations with prediction uncertainty estimates generated
  by adaptive conformal inference, and it uses these estimates to guide the agent’s
  behavior through constrained reinforcement learning. The system helps regulate the
  agent’s actions and enables it to adapt to distribution shifts. In the in-distribution
  setting, our approach achieves a 96.93% success rate, which is over 8.80% higher
  than the previous state-of-the-art baselines with over 3.72 times fewer collisions
  and 2.43 times fewer intrusions into ground-truth human future trajectories. In
  three out-of-distribution scenarios, our method shows much stronger robustness when
  facing distribution shifts in velocity variations, policy changes, and transitions
  from individual to group dynamics. We deploy our method on a real robot, and experiments
  show that the robot makes safe and robust decisions when interacting with both sparse
  and dense crowds.

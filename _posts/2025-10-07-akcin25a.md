title: Distributed Upload and Active Labeling for Resource-Constrained Fleet Learning
section: Poster
openreview: M1e2PEMLp2
abstract: In multi-robot systems, fleets are often deployed to collect data that improves
  the performance of machine learning models for downstream perception and planning.
  However, real-world robotic deployments generate vast amounts of data across diverse
  conditions, while only a small portion can be transmitted or labeled due to limited
  bandwidth, constrained onboard storage, and high annotation costs. To address these
  challenges, we propose Distributed Upload and Active Labeling (DUAL), a decentralized,
  two-stage data collection framework for resource-constrained robotic fleets. In
  the first stage, each robot independently selects a subset of its local observations
  to upload under storage and communication constraints. In the second stage, the
  cloud selects a subset of uploaded data to label, subject to a global annotation
  budget. We evaluate DUAL on classification tasks spanning multiple sensing modalities,
  as well as on RoadNetâ€”a real-world dataset we collected from vehicle-mounted cameras
  for time and weather classification. We further validate our approach in a physical
  experiment using a Franka Emika Panda robot arm, where it learns to move a red cube
  to a green bowl. Finally, we test DUAL on trajectory prediction using the nuScenes
  autonomous driving dataset to assess generalization to complex prediction tasks.
  Across all settings, DUAL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
  up to 31.1% gain in classification accuracy and a 13% improvement in real-world
  robotics task completion rates.

title: Sampling-based System Identification with Active Exploration for Legged Sim2Real
  Learning
section: Oral
openreview: UTPBM4dEUS
abstract: Sim-to-real discrepancies hinder learning-based policies from achieving
  high-precision tasks in the real world. While Domain Randomization (DR) is commonly
  used to bridge this gap, it often relies on heuristics and can lead to overly conservative
  policies with degrading performance when not properly tuned. System Identification
  (Sys-ID) offers a targeted approach, but standard techniques rely on differentiable
  dynamics and/or direct torque measurement, assumptions that rarely hold for contact-rich
  legged systems. To this end, we present SPI-Active (Sampling-based Parameter Identification
  with Active Exploration), a two-stage framework that estimates physical parameters
  of legged robots to minimize the sim-to-real gap. SPI-Active robustly identifies
  key physical parameters through massive parallel sampling, minimizing state prediction
  errors between simulated and real-world trajectories. To further improve the informativeness
  of collected data, we introduce an active exploration strategy that maximizes the
  Fisher Information of the collected real-world trajectories via optimizing the input
  commands of an exploration policy. This targeted exploration leads to accurate identification
  and better generalization across diverse tasks. Experimental results demonstrate
  that SPI-Active enables precise sim-to-real transfer of learned policies to the
  real world, outperforming baselines by 42-63% in various locomotion tasks. Videos

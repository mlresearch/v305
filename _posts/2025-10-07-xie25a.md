title: Data Retrieval with Importance Weights for Few-Shot Imitation Learning
section: Oral
openreview: wnWYoetLhC
abstract: While large-scale robot datasets have propelled recent progress in imitation
  learning, learning from smaller task specific datasets remains critical for deployment
  in new environments and unseen tasks. One such approach to few-shot imitation learning
  is retrieval-based imitation learning, which extracts relevant samples from large,
  widely available prior datasets to augment a limited demonstration dataset. To determine
  the relevant data from prior datasets, retrieval-based approaches most commonly
  calculate a prior data pointâ€™s minimum distance to a point in the target dataset
  in latent space. While retrieval-based methods have shown success using this metric
  for data selection, we demonstrate its equivalence to the limit of a Gaussian kernel
  density (KDE) estimate of the target data distribution. This reveals two shortcomings
  of the retrieval rule used in prior work. First, it relies on high-variance nearest
  neighbor estimates that are susceptible to noise. Second, it does not account for
  the distribution of prior data when retrieving data. To address these issues, we
  introduce Importance Weighted Retrieval (IWR), which estimates importance weights,
  or the ratio between the target and prior data distributions for retrieval, using
  Gaussian KDEs. By considering the probability ratio, IWR overcomes the bias of previous
  selection rules, and by using reasonable modeling parameters, IWR effectively smooths
  estimates using all data points.  Across both simulation environments and real-world
  evaluations on the Bridge dataset we find that our method, IWR, consistently improves
  performance of existing retrieval-based methods, despite only requiring minor modifications.

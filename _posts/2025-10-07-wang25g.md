title: Do LLM Modules Generalize? A Study on Motion Generation for Autonomous Driving
section: Poster
openreview: AP7kM1xk2a
abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have not only advanced
  natural language processing but also inspired their application in domains with
  structurally similar problems—most notably, autonomous driving motion generation.
  Both domains involve autoregressive sequence modeling, token-based representations,
  and context-aware decision making, making the transfer of LLM components a natural
  and increasingly common practice. However, despite promising early attempts, a systematic
  understanding of which LLM modules are truly transferable remains lacking. In this
  paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of five key LLM modules—tokenizer design,
  positional embedding, pre-training paradigms, post-training strategies, and test-time
  computation—within the context of motion generation for autonomous driving. Through
  extensive experiments on the Waymo Sim Agents benchmark, we demonstrate that, when
  appropriately adapted, these modules can significantly improve performance for autonomous
  driving motion generation. In addition, we identify which techniques can be effectively
  transferred, analyze the potential reasons for the failure of others, and discuss
  the specific adaptations needed for autonomous driving scenarios. We evaluate our
  method on the Sim Agents task and achieve competitive results.

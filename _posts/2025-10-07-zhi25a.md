title: Learning a Unified Policy for Position and Force Control in Legged Loco-Manipulation
section: Oral
openreview: MpJTyAqA0t
abstract: Robotic loco-manipulation tasks often involve contact-rich interactions
  with the environment, requiring the joint modeling of contact force and robot position.
  However, recent visuomotor policies often focus solely on position or force control,
  overlooking their integration. In this work, we propose a unified policy for legged
  robots that jointly models force and position control learned without reliance on
  force sensors. By simulating diverse combinations of active position and force commands
  alongside external disturbances force, we use reinforcement learning to learn a
  policy that estimates forces from the robot’s historical states and compensates
  for them through position and velocity adjustments. Such a policy enables a wide
  range of manipulation behaviors under varying combinations of force and position
  inputs, including position tracking, force application, force tracking, and compliant
  robot behaviors. Additionally, we demonstrate that the learned policy enhances trajectory-based
  imitation learning pipelines by incorporating essential contact information through
  its force estimation module, achieving approximately  39.5% higher success rates
  across four challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks compared to position-control
  policies. Extensive experiments on both a quadrupedal mobile manipulation platform
  and a humanoid validate the versatility and robustness of the proposed policy across
  diverse scenarios.

section: Poster
openreview: BTUioBmCWo
abstract: Training general-purpose robots requires learning from large and diverse
  data sources. Current approaches rely heavily on teleoperated demonstrations which
  are difficult to scale. We present a scalable framework for training manipulation
  policies directly from human video demonstrations, requiring no robot data. Our
  method converts human demonstrations into robot-compatible observation-action pairs
  using hand pose estimation and visual data editing. We inpaint the human arm and
  overlay a rendered robot to align the visual domains. This enables zero-shot deployment
  on real hardware without any fine-tuning. We demonstrate strong success rates—up
  to 92%—on a range of tasks including deformable object manipulation, multi-object
  sweeping, and insertion. Our approach generalizes to novel environments and supports
  closed-loop execution. By demonstrating that effective policies can be trained using
  only human videos, our method broadens the path to scalable robot learning. Videos

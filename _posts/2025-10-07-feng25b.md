title: 'Reflective Planning: Vision-Language Models for Multi-Stage Long-Horizon Robotic
  Manipulation'
section: Poster

abstract: Solving complex long-horizon robotic manipulation problems requires sophisticated
  high-level planning capabilities, the ability to reason about the physical world,
  and reactively choose appropriate motor skills. Vision-language models (VLMs) pretrained
  on Internet data could in principle offer a framework for tackling such problems.
  However, in their current form, VLMs lack both the nuanced understanding of intricate
  physics required for robotic manipulation and the ability to reason over long horizons
  to address error compounding issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel test-time
  computation framework that enhances VLMs’ physical reasoning capabilities for multi-stage
  manipulation tasks. At its core, our approach iteratively improves a pretrained
  VLM with a “reflection” mechanism - it uses a generative model to imagine future
  world states, leverages these predictions to guide action selection, and critically
  reflects on potential suboptimalities to refine its reasoning. Experimental results
  demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art commercial
  VLMs as well as other post-training approaches such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).

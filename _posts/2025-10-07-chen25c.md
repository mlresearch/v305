title: 'MEReQ: Max-Ent Residual-Q Inverse RL for Sample-Efficient Alignment from Intervention'
section: Poster
openreview: iQQy1BKlGv
abstract: Aligning robot behavior with human preferences is crucial for deploying
  embodied AI agents in human-centered environments. A promising solution is interactive
  imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy’s
  execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often
  fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering
  sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse
  Reinforcement Learning, designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention.
  Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a
  residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert’s
  and the prior policy’s underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning
  (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function.
  Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves
  sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention compared to other baselines.

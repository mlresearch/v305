title: 'Disentangled Multi-Context Meta-Learning: Unlocking Robust and Generalized
  Task Learning'
section: Poster
openreview: 0ViTEgiFiQ
abstract: In meta-learning and its downstream tasks, many methods use implicit adaptation
  to represent task-specific variations. However, implicit approaches hinder interpretability
  and make it difficult to understand which task factors drive performance. In this
  work, we introduce a disentangled multi-context meta-learning framework that explicitly
  learns separate context vectors for different aspects that define a task. By decoupling
  these factors, our approach improves both robustness, through deeper task understanding,
  and generalization, by enabling context vector sharing across tasks with the same
  context. We evaluate our approach in two domains. First, on a sinusoidal regression
  benchmark, our model outperforms baselines on out-of-distribution tasks and generalizes
  to unseen sine functions by sharing context vectors associated with shared amplitudes
  or phase shifts. Second, in a quadruped locomotion task, we disentangle the robot-specific
  properties and the characteristics of the terrain in the robot dynamics model. Using
  these context vectors in reinforcement learning, the learned policy demonstrates
  improved robustness under out-of-distribution conditions, compared to a model using
  a single unified context. Furthermore, by effectively sharing context, our model
  enables successful sim-to-real policy transfer to challenging terrains with out-of-distribution
  robot-specific properties using only real data from flat terrain, which is not achievable
  with single-task adaptation.

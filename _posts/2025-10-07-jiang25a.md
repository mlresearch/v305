title: 'Streaming Flow Policy: Simplifying diffusion/flow-matching policies by treating
  action trajectories as flow trajectories'
section: Oral
openreview: jnpILGz9gQ
abstract: Recent advances in diffusion$/$flow-matching policies have enabled imitation
  learning of complex, multi-modal action trajectories. However, they are computationally
  expensive because they sample a *trajectory of trajectories*—a diffusion$/$flow
  trajectory of action trajectories. They discard intermediate action trajectories,
  and must wait for the sampling process to complete before any actions can be executed
  on the robot. We simplify diffusion$/$flow policies by *treating action trajectories
  as flow trajectories*. Instead of starting from pure noise, our algorithm samples
  from a narrow Gaussian around the last action. Then, it incrementally integrates
  a velocity field learned via flow matching to produce a sequence of actions that
  constitute a *single* trajectory. This enables actions to be streamed to the robot
  on-the-fly *during* the flow sampling process, and is well-suited for receding horizon
  policy execution. Despite streaming, our method retains the ability to model multi-modal
  behavior. We train flows that *stabilize* around demonstration trajectories to reduce
  distribution shift and improve imitation learning performance. Streaming flow policy
  outperforms prior methods while enabling faster policy execution and tighter sensorimotor
  loops for learning-based robot control.

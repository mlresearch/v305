title: 'CHD: Coupled Hierarchical Diffusion for Long-Horizon Tasks'
section: Poster
openreview: tXY6VQlXfA
abstract: Diffusion-based planners have shown strong performance in short-horizon
  tasks but often fail in complex, long-horizon settings. We trace the failure to
  loose coupling between high-level (HL) sub-goal selection and low-level (LL) trajectory
  generation, which leads to incoherent plans and degraded performance. We propose
  Coupled Hierarchical Diffusion (CHD), a framework that models HL sub-goals and LL
  trajectories jointly within a unified diffusion process. A shared classifier passes
  LL feedback upstream so that sub-goals self-correct while sampling proceeds. This
  tight HLâ€“LL coupling improves trajectory coherence and enables scalable long-horizon
  diffusion planning. Experiments across maze navigation, tabletop manipulation, and
  household environments show that CHD consistently outperforms both flat and hierarchical
  diffusion baselines.

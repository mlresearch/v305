title: Self-supervised perception for tactile skin covered dexterous hands
section: Poster
openreview: eLeCrM5PEO
abstract: We present PercepSkin, a pre-trained encoder for magnetic skin sensors distributed
  across the fingertips, phalanges, and palm of a dexterous robot hand.  Magnetic
  tactile skins offer a flexible form factor for hand-wide coverage with fast response
  times, in contrast to vision-based tactile sensors that are restricted to the fingertips
  and limited by bandwidth. Full hand tactile perception is crucial for robot dexterity.
  However, a lack of general-purpose models, challenges with interpreting magnetic
  flux and calibration have limited the adoption of these sensors. PercepSkin, given
  a history of kinematic and tactile sensing across a hand, outputs a latent tactile
  embedding that can be used in any downstream task. The encoder is self-supervised
  via self-distillation on a variety of unlabeled hand-object  interactions using
  an Allegro hand sensorized with Xela uSkin. In experiments across several benchmark
  tasks, from state estimation to policy learning, we find that pretrained PercepSkin
  representations are both sample efficient in learning downstream tasks and improve
  task performance by over 41% compared to prior work and over 56% compared to end-to-end
  learning.

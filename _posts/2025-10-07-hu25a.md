  Humanoids'
section: Poster
openreview: oRwcxFuN25
abstract: 'Simulation-based reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced
  humanoid locomotion tasks, yet direct real-world RL from scratch or starting from
  pretrained policies remains rare, limiting the full potential of humanoid robots.
  Real-world training, despite being crucial for overcoming the sim-to-real gap, faces
  substantial challenges related to safety, reward design, and learning efficiency.
  To address these limitations, we propose Robot-Trains-Robot (RTR), a novel framework
  where a robotic arm teacher actively supports and guides a humanoid student robot.
  The RTR system provides protection, schedule, reward, perturbation, failure detection,
  and automatic resets, enabling efficient long-term real-world training with minimal
  human intervention. Furthermore, we propose a novel RL pipeline that facilitates
  and stabilizes sim-to-real transfer by optimizing a single dynamics-encoded latent
  variable in the real world. We validate our method through two challenging real-world
  humanoid tasks: fine-tuning a walking policy for precise speed tracking and learning
  a humanoid swing-up task from scratch, illustrating the promising capabilities of
  real-world humanoid learning realized by RTR-style systems.'

title: 'LocoFormer: Generalist Locomotion via Long-context Adaptation'
section: Oral
openreview: VqmAvBkFhw
abstract: Humans and animals exhibit flexible locomotion strategies, such as learning
  to walk within minutes, and efficient adaptation to changes in morphology. In contrast,
  modern locomotion controllers are manually tuned for specific embodiments. In this
  paper, we present LocoFormer, a generalist policy that can control previously unseen
  legged and wheeled robots, even without precise knowledge of their kinematics. LocoFormer
  is able to adapt to changes in morphology and dynamics at test time. We find that
  two key choices enable adaptation. First, we train massive scale RL on procedurally
  generated robots with aggressive domain randomization. Second, in contrast to previous
  policies that are myopic with short context lengths, we extend context by orders
  of magnitude to span episode boundaries. We deploy the same LocoFormer to varied
  robots, and show robust control even with large disturbances such as weight and
  motor failures. In extreme scenarios, we see emergent adaptation across episodes,
  LocoFormer learns from falls in early episodes to improve control strategies in
  later ones. We believe this simple yet general recipe can be used to train foundation
  models for other robotic skills in the future. Videos at generalist-locomotion.github.io.

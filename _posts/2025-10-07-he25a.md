abstract: 'We present Latent Theory of Mind (LatentToM), a decentralized diffusion
  policy architecture for collaborative robot manipulation. Our policy allows multiple
  manipulators with their own perception and computation to collaborate with each
  other towards a common task goal with or without explicit communication. Our key
  innovation lies in allowing each agent to maintain two latent representations: an
  ego embedding specific to the robot, and a consensus embedding trained to be common
  to both robots, despite their different sensor streams and poses. We further let
  each robot train a decoder to infer the other robot’s ego embedding from their consensus
  embedding, akin to "theory of mind" in latent space. Training occurs centrally,
  with all the policies’ consensus encoders supervised by a loss inspired by sheaf
  theory, a mathematical theory for clustering data on a topological manifold. Specifically,
  we introduce a first-order cohomology loss to enforce sheaf-consistent alignment
  of the consensus embeddings. To preserve the expressiveness of the consensus embedding,
  we further propose structural constraints based on theory of mind and a directional
  consensus mechanism. Execution can be fully distributed, requiring no explicit communication
  between policies. In which case, the information is exchanged implicitly through
  each robot’s sensor stream by observing the actions of the other robots and their
  effects on the scene. Alternatively, execution can leverage direct communication
  to share the robots’ consensus embeddings, where the embeddings are shared once
  during each inference step and are aligned using the sheaf Laplacian. While we tested
  our method using two manipulators, our approach can naturally be extended to an
  arbitrary number of agents. In our hardware experiments, LatentToM outperforms a
  naive decentralized diffusion baseline, and shows comparable performance with a
  state-of-the-art centralized diffusion policy for bi-manual manipulation. Additionally,
  we show that LatentToM is naturally robust to temporary robot failure or delays,
  while a centralized policy may fail.'

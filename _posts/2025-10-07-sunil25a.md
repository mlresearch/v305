title: Reactive In-Air Clothing Manipulation with Confidence-Aware Dense Correspondence
  and Visuotactile Affordance
section: Oral
openreview: sXoaNAECCK
abstract: Manipulating clothing is challenging due to their complex, variable configurations
  and frequent self-occlusion. While prior systems often rely on flattening garments,
  humans routinely identify keypoints in highly crumpled and suspended states. We
  present a novel, task-agnostic, visuotactile framework that operates directly on
  crumpled clothingâ€”including in-air configurations that have not been addressed before.
  Our approach combines global visual perception with local tactile feedback to enable
  robust, reactive manipulation. We train dense visual descriptors on a custom simulated
  dataset using a distributional loss that captures cloth symmetries and generates
  correspondence confidence estimates. These estimates guide a reactive state machine
  that dynamically selects between folding strategies based on perceptual uncertainty.
  In parallel, we train a visuotactile grasp affordance network using high-resolution
  tactile feedback to supervise grasp success. The same tactile classifier is used
  during execution for real-time grasp validation. Together, these components enable
  a reactive, task-agnostic framework for in-air garment manipulation, including folding
  and hanging tasks. Moreover, our dense descriptors serve as a versatile intermediate
  representation for other planning modalities, such as extracting grasp targets from
  human video demonstrations, paving the way for more generalizable and scalable garment
  manipulation.

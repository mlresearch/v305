title: 'Tactile Beyond Pixels: Multisensory Touch Representations for Robot Manipulation'
section: Oral
openreview: sMs4pJYhWi
abstract: 'We present TacX, the first multisensory touch representations across four
  tactile modalities: image, audio, motion, and pressure. Trained on  1M contact-rich
  interactions collected with the Digit 360 sensor, TacX captures complementary touch
  signals at diverse temporal and spatial scales. By leveraging self-supervised learning,
  TacX fuses these modalities into a unified representation that captures physical
  properties useful for downstream robot manipulation tasks. We study how to effectively
  integrate real-world touch representations for both imitation learning and tactile
  adaptation of sim-trained policies, showing that TacX boosts policy success rates
  by 63% over an end-to-end model using tactile images and improves robustness by
  90% in recovering object states from touch. Finally, we benchmark TacX’s ability
  to make inference about physical properties, such as object-action identification,
  material-quantity estimation and force estimation. TacX improves accuracy in characterizing
  physical properties by 48% compared to end-to-end approaches, demonstrating the
  advantages of multisensory pretraining for capturing features essential for dexterous
  manipulation.'

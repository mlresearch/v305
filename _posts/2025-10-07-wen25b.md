abstract: 'Enabling robots to perform diverse tasks across varied environments is
  a central challenge in robot learning. While vision-language-action (VLA) models
  have shown promise for generalizable robot skills, realizing their full potential
  requires addressing limitations in action representation and efficient training.
  Current VLA models often focus on scaling the vision-language model (VLM) component,
  while the action space representation remains a critical bottleneck. This paper
  introduces DexVLA, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency and generalization
  capabilities of VLAs for complex, long-horizon tasks across diverse robot embodiments.
  DexVLA features a novel diffusion-based action expert, scaled to one billion parameters,
  designed for cross-embodiment learning. A novel embodiment curriculum learning strategy
  facilitates efficient training: (1) pre-training the diffusion expert on cross-embodiment
  data, (2) aligning the VLA model to specific embodiments, and (3) post-training
  for rapid adaptation to new tasks.  We conduct comprehensive experiments across
  multiple embodiments, including single-arm, bimanual, and dexterous hand, demonstrating
  DexVLAâ€™s adaptability to challenging tasks without task-specific adaptation, its
  ability to learn dexterous skills on novel embodiments with limited data, and its
  capacity to complete complex, long-horizon tasks using only direct language prompting,
  such as laundry folding. In all settings, our method demonstrates superior performance
  compared to state-of-the-art models like OpenVLA and $\pi_{0}$.'

title: Generalist Robot Manipulation beyond Action Labeled Data
section: Poster
openreview: ZqBXnR6ppz
abstract: 'Recent advances in generalist robot manipulation leverage pre-trained Vision–Language
  Models (VLMs) and large-scale robot demonstrations to tackle diverse tasks in a
  zero-shot manner. A key challenge remains: scaling high-quality, action-labeled
  robot demonstration data, which existing methods rely on for robustness and generalization.
  To address this, we propose a method that benefits from videos without action labels—featuring
  humans and/or robots in action—enhancing open-vocabulary performance and enabling
  data-efficient learning of new tasks. Our method extracts dense, dynamic 3D point
  clouds at the hand or gripper location and uses a proposed 3D dynamics predictor
  for self-supervision. This predictor is then tuned to an action predictor using
  a smaller labeled dataset for action alignment. We show that our method not only
  learns from unlabeled human and robot demonstrations—improving downstream generalist
  robot policies—but also enables robots to learn new tasks without action labels
  (i.e., out-of-action generalization) in both real-world and simulated settings.'

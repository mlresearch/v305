abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, pre-trained on large-scale imitation
  learning datasets, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visuomotor control.
  However, these models exhibit diverse failure modes in unstructured real-world environments,
  limiting the widespread adoption of VLAs in robotics. Efforts to enhance the robustness
  and generalization of VLAs have gradually shifted from the pre-training to the post-training
  phase. Yet, the potential of scaling test-time compute remains underexplored. In
  this paper, we investigate test-time scaling for robotics through the lens of sampling
  and verification. We first demonstrate that the relationship between action error
  and the number of generated samples follows an exponentiated power law across a
  range of VLAs, indicating the existence of inference-time scaling laws. Building
  on this insight, we propose a synthetic data generation pipeline for training a
  Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based action verifier, and show that scaling the synthetic
  dataset consistently improves verification and downstream accuracy. We then introduce
  RoboMonkey, a test-time scaling framework for VLAs. At deployment, RoboMonkey samples
  a small set of actions from a VLA, applies Gaussian perturbations and majority voting
  to construct an action proposal distribution, and then uses the VLM-based verifier
  to select the optimal action. Through extensive evaluations across simulated and
  real-world environments, we show that pairing existing VLAs with RoboMonkey yields
  significant performance gains, achieving a 25% absolute improvement on out-of-distribution
  tasks and 8% higher average success rate on in-distribution tasks. Additionally,
  when adapting to new robot setups, we show that fine-tuning both VLAs and action
  verifiers yields a 7% performance increase compared to fine-tuning VLAs alone.

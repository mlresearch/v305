title: 'GC-VLN: Instruction as Graph Constraints for Training-free Vision-and-Language
  Navigation'
section: Poster
openreview: mjYKNIRqpy
abstract: In this paper, we propose a training-free framework for vision-and-language
  navigation (VLN). Existing zero-shot VLN methods are mainly designed for discrete
  environments or involve unsupervised training in continuous simulator environments,
  which makes it challenging to generalize and deploy them in real-world scenarios.
  To achieve a training-free framework in continuous environments, our framework formulates
  navigation guidance as graph constraint optimization by decomposing instructions
  into explicit spatial constraints. The constraint-driven paradigm decodes spatial
  semantics through constraint solving, enabling zero-shot adaptation to unseen environments.
  Specifically, we construct a spatial constraint library covering all types of spatial
  relationship mentioned in VLN instructions. The human instruction is decomposed
  into a directed acyclic graph, with waypoint nodes, object nodes and edges, which
  are used as queries to retrieve the library to build the graph constraints. The
  graph constraint optimization is solved by the constraint solver to determine the
  positions of waypoints, obtaining the robotâ€™s navigation path and final goal. To
  handle cases of no solution or multiple solutions, we construct the navigation tree
  and the backtracking mechanism. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
  significant improvements in success rate and navigation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art
  zero-shot VLN methods. We further conduct real-world experiments to show our framework
  can effectively generalize to new environments and instruction sets, paving the
  way for more robust and autonomous navigation framework.

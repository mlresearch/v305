abstract: Autonomous skill discovery aims to enable robots to acquire diverse be-haviors
  without explicit supervision. Learning such behaviors directly on physical hardware
  remains challenging due to safety and data efficiency constraints. Existing methods,
  including Quality-Diversity Actor-Critic (QDAC), require manually defined skill
  spaces and carefully tuned heuristics, limiting real-world applicability. We propose
  Unsupervised Real-world Skill Acquisition (URSA), an extension of QDAC that enables
  robots to autonomously discover and master diverse, high-performing skills directly
  in the real world. We demonstrate that URSA successfully discovers diverse locomotion
  skills on a Unitree A1 quadruped in both simulation and the real world. Our approach
  supports both heuristic-driven skill discovery and fully unsupervised settings.
  We also show that the learn skill repertoire can be reused for downstream tasks
  such as real-world damage adaptation, where URSA outperforms all baselines in 5
  out of 9 simulated and 3 out of 5 real-world damage scenarios. Our results establish
  a new framework for real-world robot learning that enables continuous skill discovery
  with limited human intervention, representing a significant step toward more autonomous
  and adaptable robotic systems.

title: Diffusion Dynamics Models with Generative State Estimation for Cloth Manipulation
section: Poster
openreview: oDUbsdc0Ru
abstract: Cloth manipulation is challenging due to its highly complex dynamics, near-infinite
  degrees of freedom, and frequent self-occlusions, which complicate both state estimation
  and dynamics modeling. Inspired by recent advances in generative models, we hypothesize
  that these expressive models can effectively capture intricate cloth configurations
  and deformation patterns from data. Therefore, we propose a diffusion-based generative
  approach for both perception and dynamics modeling. Specifically, we formulate state
  estimation as reconstructing full cloth states from partial observations and dynamics
  modeling as predicting future states given the current state and robot actions.
  Leveraging a transformer-based diffusion model, our method achieves accurate state
  reconstruction and reduces long-horizon dynamics prediction errors by an order of
  magnitude compared to prior approaches. We integrate our dynamics models with model-predictive
  control and show that our framework enables effective cloth folding on real robotic
  systems, demonstrating the potential of generative models for deformable object
  manipulation under partial observability and complex dynamics.

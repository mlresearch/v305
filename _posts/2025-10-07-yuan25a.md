title: 'BEVCalib: LiDAR-Camera Calibration via Geometry-Guided Bird’s-Eye View Representation'
section: Poster
openreview: 9FpccnRarn
abstract: Accurate LiDAR-camera calibration is the foundation of accurate multimodal
  fusion environmental perception for autonomous driving and robotic systems. Traditional
  calibration methods require extensive data collection in controlled environments
  and cannot compensate for the transformation changes during the vehicle/robot movement.
  In this paper, we propose the first model that uses bird’s-eye view (BEV) features
  to perform LiDAR camera calibration from raw data, termed BEVCalib. To achieve this,
  we extract camera BEV features and LiDAR BEV features separately and fuse them into
  a shared BEV feature space. To fully utilize the geometry information from the BEV
  feature, we introduce a novel feature selector to choose the most important feature
  in the transformation decoder, which reduces memory consumption and enables efficient
  training. Extensive evaluations in various datasets demonstrate that BEVCalib establishes
  a new state-of-the-art; improving the best open-source baseline by two orders of
  magnitude on KITTI, Nuscenes, and our dynamic extrinsic dataset, respectively, and
  outperforming the best baseline in literature by 72% on KITTI dataset, and 69% on
  Nuscenes dataset. All source code and checkpoints will be released.

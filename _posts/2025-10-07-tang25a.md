abstract: Imitating tool manipulation from human videos offers an intuitive approach
  to teaching robots, while also providing a promising and scalable alternative to
  labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for visuomotor policy learning. While
  humans can mimic tool manipulation behavior by observing others perform a task just
  once and effortlessly transfer the skill to diverse tools for functionally equivalent
  tasks, current robots struggle to achieve this level of generalization. A key challenge
  lies in establishing function-level correspondences, considering the significant
  geometric variations among functionally similar tools, referred to as intra-function
  variations. To address this challenge, we propose MimicFunc, a framework that establishes
  functional correspondences with function frame, a function-centric local coordinate
  frame constructed with 3D functional keypoints, for imitating tool manipulation
  skills. Experiments demonstrate that MimicFunc effectively enables the robot to
  generalize the skill from a single RGB-D human video to manipulating novel tools
  for functionally equivalent tasks. Furthermore, leveraging MimicFuncâ€™s one-shot
  generalization capability, the generated rollouts can be used to train visuomotor
  policies without requiring labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for novel
  objects.

title: Generative Visual Foresight Meets Task-Agnostic Pose Estimation in Robotic
  Table-top Manipulation
section: Poster
openreview: VmCkEvRULX
abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires systems that
  can generalize across diverse tasks while maintaining robust and reliable performance.
  We introduce GVF-TAPE, a closed-loop framework that combines generative visual foresight
  with task-agnostic pose estimation to enable scalable robotic manipulation. GVF-TAPE
  employs a generative video model to predict future RGB-D frames from a single RGB
  side-view image and a task description, offering visual plans that guide robot actions.
  A decoupled pose estimation model then extracts end-effector poses from the predicted
  frames, translating them into executable commands via low-level controllers. By
  iteratively integrating video foresight and pose estimation in a closed loop, GVF-TAPE
  achieves real-time, adaptive manipulation across a broad range of tasks. Extensive
  experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our approach
  reduces reliance on task-specific action data and generalizes effectively, providing
  a practical and scalable solution for intelligent robotic systems

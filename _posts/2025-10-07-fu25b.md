title: Contrastive Forward Prediction Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Fault-Tolerant
  Legged Robots
section: Poster
openreview: P0uqo7CpL8
abstract: In complex environments, adaptive and fault-tolerant capabilities are essential
  for legged robot locomotion. To address this challenge, this study proposes a reinforcement
  learning framework that integrates contrastive learning with forward prediction
  to achieve fault-tolerant locomotion for legged robots. This framework constructs
  a forward prediction model with contrastive learning, incorporating a comparator
  and a forward model. The forward model predicts the robotâ€™s subsequent state, and
  the comparator compares these predictions with actual states to generate critical
  prediction errors. These errors are systematically integrated into the controller,
  facilitating the continuous adjustment and refinement of control signals.Experiments
  on quadruped robots across different terrains and various joint damage scenarios
  have verified the effectiveness of our method, especially the functions of the comparator
  and the forward model. Furthermore, robots can adapt to locked joints without prior
  training, demonstrating zero-shot transfer capability. Finally, the proposed method
  demonstrates universal applicability to both quadruped and hexapod robots, highlighting
  its potential for broader applications in legged robotics.

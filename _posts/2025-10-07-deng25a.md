  Action Data'
section: Poster

abstract: Embodied foundation models are gaining increasing attention for their zero-shot
  generalization, scalability, and adaptability to new tasks through few-shot post-training.
  However, existing models rely heavily on real-world data, which is costly and labor-intensive
  to collect. Synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative, yet its potential
  remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we explore the feasibility of
  training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models entirely with large-scale synthetic
  action data. We curate SynGrasp-1B, a billion-frame robotic grasping dataset generated
  in simulation with photorealistic rendering and extensive domain randomization.
  Building on this, we present GraspVLA, a VLA model pretrained on large-scale synthetic
  action data as a foundational model for grasping tasks. GraspVLA integrates autoregressive
  perception tasks and a flow-matching-based action generation into a unified Chain-of-Thought
  process, enabling joint training on synthetic action data and Internet semantics
  data. This design helps mitigate sim-to-real gaps and facilitates the transfer of
  learned actions to a broader range of Internet-covered objects, achieving open-vocabulary
  generalization in grasping. Extensive evaluations across real-world and simulation
  benchmarks demonstrate GraspVLAâ€™s advanced zero-shot generalizability and few-shot
  adaptability to specific human preferences. We will release SynGrasp-1B dataset
  and pre-trained weights to benefit the community.

title: Residual Neural Terminal Constraint for MPC-based Collision Avoidance in Dynamic
  Environments
section: Poster
openreview: seSw6ssEid
abstract: In this paper, we propose a hybrid MPC local planner that uses a learning-based
  approximation of a time-varying safe set, derived from local observations and applied
  as the MPC terminal constraint. This set can be represented as a zero-superlevel
  set of the value function computed via Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis,
  which is infeasible in real-time. We exploit the property that the HJ value function
  can be expressed as a difference of the corresponding signed distance function (SDF)
  and a non-negative residual function. The residual component is modeled as a neural
  network with non-negative output and subtracted from the computed SDF, resulting
  in a real-time value function estimate that is at least as safe as the SDF by design.
  Additionally, we parametrize the neural residual by a hypernetwork to improve real-time
  performance and generalization properties. The proposed method is compared with
  three state-of-the-art methods in simulations and hardware experiments, achieving
  up to 30% higher success rates compared to the best baseline while requiring a similar
  computational effort and producing high-quality (low travel-time) solutions.

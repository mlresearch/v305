title: 'Omni-Perception: Omnidirectional Collision Avoidance of Legged Robots in Dynamic
  Environments'
section: Oral
openreview: KUSYJIlKor
abstract: Agile locomotion in complex 3D environments requires robust spatial awareness
  to safely avoid diverse obstacles such as aerial clutter, uneven terrain, and dynamic
  agents. Depth-based perception approaches often struggle with sensor noise, lighting
  variability, computational overhead from intermediate representations (e.g., elevation
  maps), and difficulties with non-planar obstacles, limiting performance in unstructured
  environments. In contrast, direct integration of LiDAR sensing into end-to-end learning
  for legged locomotion remains underexplored.We propose Omni-Perception, an end-to-end
  locomotion policy that achieves 3D spatial awareness and omnidirectional collision
  avoidance by directly processing raw LiDAR point clouds. At its core is PD-RiskNet
  (Proximal-Distal Risk-Aware Hierarchical Network), a novel perception module that
  interprets spatio-temporal LiDAR data for environmental risk assessment. To facilitate
  efficient policy learning, we develop a high-fidelity LiDAR simulation toolkit with
  realistic noise modeling and fast raycasting, compatible with platforms such as
  Isaac Gym, Genesis, and MuJoCo, enabling scalable training and effective sim-to-real
  transfer.Learning reactive control policies directly from raw LiDAR data enables
  the robot to navigate complex environments with static and dynamic obstacles more
  robustly than approaches relying on intermediate maps or limited sensing. We validate
  Omni-Perception through real-world experiments and extensive simulation, demonstrating
  strong omnidirectional avoidance capabilities and superior locomotion performance
  in highly dynamic environments.We will open-source our code and models.

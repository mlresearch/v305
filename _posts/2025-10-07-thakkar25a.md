  device for Multimodal robot Perception'

abstract: 'Robust robot manipulation in unstructured environments often requires understanding
  object properties that extend beyond geometry, such as material or complianceâ€”properties
  that can be challenging to infer using vision alone. Multimodal haptic sensing provides
  a promising avenue for inferring such properties, yet progress has been constrained
  by the lack of large, diverse, and realistic haptic datasets. In this work, we introduce
  the CLAMP device, a low-cost (< $200) sensorized reacher-grabber designed to collect
  large-scale, in-the-wild multimodal haptic data from non-expert users in everyday
  settings. We deployed 16 CLAMP devices to 41 participants, resulting in the CLAMP
  dataset, the largest open-source multimodal haptic dataset to date, comprising 12.3
  million datapoints across 5357 household objects. Using this dataset, we train a
  haptic encoder that can infer material and compliance object properties from multimodal
  haptic data. We leverage this encoder to create the CLAMP model, a visuo-haptic
  perception model for material recognition that generalizes to novel objects and
  three robot embodiments with minimal finetuning. We also demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our model in three real-world robot manipulation tasks: sorting recyclable and
  non-recyclable waste, retrieving objects from a cluttered bag, and distinguishing
  overripe from ripe bananas. Our results show that large-scale, in-the-wild haptic
  data collection can unlock new capabilities for generalizable robot manipulation.'

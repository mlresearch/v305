title: Constrained Style Learning from Imperfect Demonstrations under Task Optimality
section: Poster
openreview: TFbT7kHD89
abstract: Learning from demonstration has proven effective in robotics for acquiring
  natural behaviors, such as stylistic motions and lifelike agility, particularly
  when explicitly defining style-oriented reward functions is challenging. Synthesizing
  stylistic motions for real-world tasks usually requires balancing task performance
  and imitation quality. Existing methods generally depend on expert demonstrations
  closely aligned with task objectives. However, practical demonstrations are often
  incomplete or unrealistic, causing current methods to boost style at the expense
  of task performance. To address this issue, we propose formulating the problem as
  a  constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). Our approach integrates a style-imitation
  objective with constraints to maintain near-optimal task performance. We introduce
  an adaptively adjustable Lagrangian multiplier to guide the agent to imitate demonstrations
  selectively, capturing stylistic nuances without compromising task performance.
  We validate our approach across multiple robotic platforms and tasks, demonstrating
  both robust task performance and high-fidelity style learning. On ANYmal-D hardware
  we show a 14.5% drop in mechanical energy and a more agile gait pattern, showcasing
  real-world benefits.

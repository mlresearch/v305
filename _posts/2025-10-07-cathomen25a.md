title: 'Divide, Discover, Deploy: Factorized Skill Learning with Symmetry and Style
  Priors'
section: Oral
openreview: Ddb8w8FVV9
abstract: Unsupervised Skill Discovery (USD) allows agents to autonomously learn diverse
  behaviors without task-specific rewards. While recent USD methods have shown promise,
  their application to real-world robotics remains underexplored. In this paper, we
  propose a modular USD framework to address the challenges in safety, interpretability,
  and deployability of the learned skills. Our approach factorizes the state space
  to learn disentangled skill representations and assigns different skill discovery
  algorithms to each factor based on the desired intrinsic reward function. To encourage
  structured morphology-aware skills, we introduce symmetry-based inductive biases
  tailored to individual factors. We also incorporate a style factor and regularization
  penalties to promote safe and robust behaviors. We evaluate our framework in simulation
  using a quadrupedal robot and demonstrate zero-shot transfer of the learned skills
  to real hardware. Our results show that factorization and symmetry lead to the discovery
  of structured, human-interpretable behaviors, while the style factor and penalties
  enhance safety and diversity. Additionally, we show that the learned skills can
  be used for downstream tasks and perform on par with oracle policies trained with
  hand-crafted rewards. To facilitate future research, we will release our code upon
  publication.

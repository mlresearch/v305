title: 'Hand-Eye Autonomous Delivery: Learning Humanoid Navigation, Locomotion and
  Reaching'
section: Poster
openreview: H0EgeP3feg
abstract: We propose Hand-Eye Autonomous Delivery (HEAD), a framework that learns
  navigation, locomotion, and reaching skills for humanoids, directly from human motion
  and vision perception data. We take a modular approach where the high-level planner
  commands the target position and orientation of the hands and eyes of the humanoid,
  delivered by the low-level policy that controls the whole-body movements. Specifically,
  the low-level whole-body controller learns to track the three points (eyes, left
  hand, and right hand) from existing large-scale human motion capture data while
  high-level policy learns from human data collected by Aria glasses. Our modular
  approach decouples the ego-centric vision perception from physical actions, promoting
  efficient learning and scalability to novel scenes. We evaluate our method both
  in simulation and in the real-world, demonstrating humanoidâ€™s capabilities to navigate
  and reach in complex environments designed for humans.

title: 'Eye, Robot: Learning to Look to Act with a BC-RL Perception-Action Loop'
section: Poster
openreview: KKpdjQK6nT
abstract: 'Humans do not passively observe the visual worldâ€”we actively look in order
  to act. Motivated by this principle, we introduce EyeRobot, a robotic system with
  gaze behavior that emerges from the need to complete real-world tasks. We develop
  a mechanical eyeball that can freely rotate to observe its surroundings and train
  a gaze policy to control it using reinforcement learning. We accomplish this by
  introducing a BC-RL loop trained using teleoperated demonstrations recorded with
  a 360 camera. The resulting video enables a simulation environment that supports
  rendering arbitrary eyeball viewpoints, allowing reinforcement learning of gaze
  behavior. The hand (BC) agent is trained from rendered eye observations, and the
  eye (RL) agent is rewarded when the hand produces correct actions. In this way,
  hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks towards regions which allow the hand
  to complete the task. We evaluate EyeRobot on five large workspace manipulation
  tasks and compare performance to two common camera setups: wrist and external cameras.
  Our experiments suggest EyeRobot exhibits hand-eye coordination which effectively
  facilitates action such as visual search or target switching, which enable manipulation
  across large workspaces.'

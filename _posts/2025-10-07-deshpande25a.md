abstract: We present GraspMolmo, a generalizable open-vocabulary task-oriented grasping
  (TOG) model. GraspMolmo predicts semantically appropriate, stable grasps conditioned
  on a natural language instruction and a single RGB-D frame. For instance, given
  "pour me some tea", GraspMolmo selects a grasp on a teapot handle rather than its
  body. Unlike prior TOG methods, which are limited by small datasets, simplistic
  language, and uncluttered scenes, GraspMolmo learns from a large-scale synthetic
  dataset of 379k samples featuring cluttered environments and diverse, realistic
  task descriptions. We fine-tune the Molmo visual-language model on this data, enabling
  GraspMolmo to generalize to novel open-vocabulary instructions and objects. In challenging
  real-world evaluations, GraspMolmo achieves state-of-the-art results, with a 70%
  prediction success on complex tasks, compared to the 35% achieved by the next best
  alternative.  GraspMolmo also successfully demonstrates the ability to predict semantically
  correct bimanual grasps zero-shot. We release our synthetic dataset, code, model,
  and benchmarks to accelerate research in task-semantic robotic manipulation.

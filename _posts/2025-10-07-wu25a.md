  Bite Acquisition'

abstract: Robot-assisted feeding requires reliable bite acquisition, a challenging
  task due to the complex interactions between utensils and food with diverse physical
  properties. These interactions are further complicated by the temporal variability
  of food properties—for example, steak becomes firm as it cools even during a meal.
  To address this, we propose SAVOR, a novel approach for learning skill affordances
  for bite acquisition—how suitable a manipulation skill (e.g., skewering, scooping)
  is for a given utensil-food interaction. In our formulation, skill affordances arise
  from the combination of tool affordances (what a utensil can do) and food affordances
  (what the food allows). Tool affordances are learned offline through calibration,
  where different utensils interact with a variety of foods to model their functional
  capabilities. Food affordances are characterized by physical properties such as
  softness, moisture, and viscosity, initially inferred through commonsense reasoning
  using a visually-conditioned language model and then dynamically refined through
  online multi-modal visuo-haptic perception using SAVOR-Net during interaction. Our
  method integrates these offline and online estimates to predict skill affordances
  in real time, enabling the robot to select the most appropriate skill for each food
  item. Evaluated on 20 single-item foods and 10 in-the-wild meals, our approach improves
  bite acquisition success by 13% over state-of-the-art (SOTA) category-based methods
  (e.g. use skewer for fruits). These results highlight the importance of modeling
  interaction-driven skill affordances for generalizable and effective robot-assisted
  bite acquisition.

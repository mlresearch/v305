title: 'One View, Many Worlds: Single-Image to 3D object Meets Generative Domain Randomization
  for One-Shot 6D Pose Estimation'
section: Oral
openreview: kto4zVmo4w
abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of arbitrary objects from a single reference image
  is a critical yet challenging task in robotics, especially considering the long-tail
  distribution of real-world instances. While category-level and model-based approaches
  have achieved notable progress, they remain limited in generalizing to unseen objects
  under one-shot settings. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline for fast and
  accurate one-shot 6D pose and scale estimation. Leveraging recent advances in single-view
  3D generation, we first build high-fidelity textured meshes without requiring known
  object poses. To resolve scale ambiguity, we introduce a coarse-to-fine alignment
  module that estimates both object size and initial pose by matching 2D-3D features
  with depth information. We then generate a diversified set of plausible 3D models
  using text-guided generative augmentation and render them with Blender to synthesize
  large-scale, domain-randomized training data for pose estiamtion. This synthetic
  data bridges the domain gap and enables robust fine-tuning of pose estimators. Our
  method achieves state-of-the-art results on several 6D pose benchmarks, and we further
  validate its effectiveness on a newly collected in-the-wild dataset. Finally, we
  integrate our system with a dexterous hand, demonstrating its robustness in real-world
  robotic grasping tasks. All code, data, and models will be released to foster future
  research.

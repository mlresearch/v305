title: Geometric Red-Teaming for Robotic Manipulation
section: Oral
openreview: ux5EptB7xZ
abstract: Standard evaluation protocols in robotic manipulation typically assess policy
  performance over curated, in-distribution test sets, offering limited insight into
  how systems fail under plausible variation.  We introduce a red-teaming framework
  that probes robustness through object-centric geometric perturbations, automatically
  generating CrashShapes—structurally valid, user-constrained mesh deformations that
  trigger catastrophic failures in pre-trained manipulation policies.  The method
  integrates a Jacobian field–based deformation model with a gradient-free, simulator-in-the-loop
  optimization strategy. Across insertion, articulation, and grasping tasks, our approach
  consistently discovers deformations that collapse policy performance, revealing
  brittle failure modes missed by static benchmarks.  By combining task-level policy
  rollouts with constraint-aware shape exploration, we aim to build a general purpose
  framework for structured, object-centric robustness evaluation in robotic manipulation.
  We additionally show that fine-tuning on individual CrashShapes, a process we refer
  to as blue-teaming, improves task success by up to 60 percentage points on those
  shapes, while preserving performance on the original object, demonstrating the utility
  of red-teamed geometries for targeted policy refinement. Finally, we validate both
  red-teaming and blue-teaming results with a real robotic arm, observing that simulated
  CrashShapes reduce task success from 90% to as low as 22.5%, and that blue-teaming
  recovers performance to up to 90% on the corresponding real-world geometry—closely
  matching simulation outcomes.

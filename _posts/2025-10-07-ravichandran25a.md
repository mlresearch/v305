title: Distilling On-device Language Models for Robot Planning with Minimal Human
  Intervention
section: Poster
openreview: 93bWCbhXJR
abstract: Large language models (LLMs) provide robots with powerful contextual reasoning
  abilities and a natural human interface. Yet, current LLM-enabled robots typically
  depend on cloud-hosted models, limiting their usability in environments with unreliable
  communication infrastructure, such as outdoor or industrial settings. We present
  PRISM, a framework for distilling small language model (SLM)-enabled robot planners
  that run on-device with minimal human supervision. Starting from an existing LLM-enabled
  planner, PRISM automatically synthesizes diverse tasks and environments, elicits
  plans from the LLM, and uses this synthetic dataset to distill a compact SLM as
  a drop-in replacement of the source model. We apply PRISM to three LLM-enabled planners
  for mapping and exploration, manipulation, and household assistance, and we demonstrate
  that PRISM improves the performance of Llama-3.2-3B from 10-20% of GPT-4oâ€™s performance
  to over 93% - using only synthetic data. We further demonstrate that the distilled
  planners generalize across heterogeneous robotic platforms (ground and aerial) and
  diverse environments (indoor and outdoor). We release all software, trained models,
  and datasets to promote reproducibility and follow-up work.

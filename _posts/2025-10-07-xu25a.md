title: "“Stack It Up!”: 3D Stable Structure Generation from 2D Hand-drawn Sketch"
section: Oral
openreview: pukgxvcOwL
abstract: Imagine a child sketching the Eiffel Tower and asking a robot to bring it
  to life. Today’s robot manipulation systems can’t act on such sketches directly—they
  require precise 3D block poses as goals, which in turn demand structural analysis
  and expert tools like CAD. We present *StackItUp*, a system that enables non-experts
  to specify complex 3D structures using only 2D front-view hand-drawn sketches. *StackItUp*
  introduces an abstract relation graph to bridge the gap between rough sketches and
  accurate 3D block arrangements, capturing the symbolic geometric relations (e.g.,
  *left-of*) and stability patterns (e.g.,*two-pillar-bridge*) while discarding noisy
  metric details from sketches. It then grounds this graph to 3D poses using compositional
  diffusion models and iteratively updates it by predicting hidden internal and rear
  supports—critical for stability but absent from the sketch. Evaluated on sketches
  of iconic landmarks and modern house designs, *StackItUp* consistently produces
  stable, multilevel 3D structures and outperforms all baselines in both stability
  and visual resemblance.

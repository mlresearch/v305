title: 'TReF-6: Inferring Task-Relevant Frames from a Single Demonstration for One-Shot
  Skill Generalization'
section: Poster
openreview: 4IuTfpWGDR
abstract: Robots often struggle to generalize from a single demonstration due to the
  lack of a transferable and interpretable spatial representation. In this work, we
  introduce TReF-6, a method that infers a simplified, abstracted 6DoF Task-Relevant
  Frame from a single trajectory. Our approach identifies an influence point purely
  from the trajectory geometry to define the origin for a local frame, which serves
  as a reference for parameterizing a Dynamic Movement Primitive (DMP). This influence
  point captures the taskâ€™s spatial structure, extending the standard DMP formulation
  beyond start-goal imitation. The inferred frame is semantically grounded via a vision-language
  model and localized in novel scenes by Grounded-SAM, enabling functionally consistent
  skill generalization. We validate TReF-6 in simulation and demonstrate robustness
  to trajectory noise. We further deploy an end-to-end pipeline on real-world manipulation
  tasks, showing that TReF-6 supports one-shot imitation learning that preserves task
  intent across diverse object configurations.

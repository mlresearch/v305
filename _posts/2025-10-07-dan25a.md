title: 'X-Sim: Cross-Embodiment Learning via Real-to-Sim-to-Real'
section: Oral
openreview: BO7qo66YJ2
abstract: 'Human videos offer a scalable way to train robot manipulation policies,
  but lack the action labels needed by standard imitation learning algorithms. Existing
  cross-embodiment approaches try to map human motion to robot actions, but often
  fail when the embodiments differ significantly. We propose X-Sim, a real-to-sim-to-real
  framework that uses object motion as a dense and transferable signal for learning
  robot policies. X-Sim starts by reconstructing a photorealistic simulation from
  an RGBD human video and tracking object trajectories to define object-centric rewards.
  These rewards are used to train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy in simulation.
  The learned policy is then distilled into an image-conditioned diffusion policy
  using synthetic rollouts rendered with varied viewpoints and lighting. To transfer
  to the real world, X-Sim introduces an online domain adaptation technique that aligns
  real and simulated observations during deployment. Importantly, X-Sim does not require
  any robot teleoperation data. We evaluate it across 5 manipulation tasks in 2 environments
  and show that it: (1) improves task progress by 30% on average over hand-tracking
  and sim-to-real baselines, (2) matches behavior cloning with 10x less data collection,
  and (3) generalizes to new camera viewpoints and test-time changes.'

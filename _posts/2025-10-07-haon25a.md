title: Mechanistic Interpretability for Steering Vision-Language-Action Models
section: Poster
openreview: YvsUD8C9QS
abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are a promising path to realizing generalist
  embodied agents that can quickly adapt to new tasks, modalities, and environments.
  However, methods for interpreting and steering VLAs fall far short of classical
  robotics pipelines, which are grounded in explicit models of kinematics, dynamics,
  and control. This lack of mechanistic insight is a central challenge for deploying
  learned policies in real-world robotics, where robustness and explainability are
  critical. Motivated by advances in mechanistic interpretability for large language
  models, we introduce the first framework for interpreting and steering VLAs via
  their internal representations, enabling direct intervention in model behavior at
  inference time. We project feedforward activations within transformer layers onto
  the token embedding basis, identifying sparse semantic directions - such as speed
  and direction - that are causally linked to action selection. Leveraging these findings,
  we introduce a general-purpose activation steering method that modulates behavior
  in real time, without fine-tuning, reward signals, or environment interaction. We
  evaluate this method on two recent open-source VLAs, Pi0 and OpenVLA, and demonstrate
  zero-shot behavioral control in simulation (LIBERO) and on a physical robot (UR5).
  This work demonstrates that interpretable components of embodied VLAs can be systematically
  harnessed for control—establishing a new paradigm for transparent and steerable
  foundation models in robotics.

title: Unsupervised Skill Discovery as Exploration for Learning Agile Locomotion
section: Poster
openreview: ZPJo9RJL15
abstract: Exploration is crucial for legged robots to learn agile locomotion behaviors
  capable of overcoming diverse obstacles.  For example, a robot may need to try different
  contact patterns and momentum profiles to successfully jump over an obstacle—but
  encouraging such diverse exploration is inherently challenging. As a result, training
  these behaviors often relies on additional techniques such as extensive reward engineering,
  expert demonstrations, or curriculum learning. However, these approaches limit generalizability,
  especially when prior knowledge or demonstration data is unavailable. In this work,
  we propose using unsupervised skill discovery as a skill-level exploration strategy
  to significantly reduce human engineering effort. Our learning framework enables
  the agent to autonomously discover diverse skills to overcome complex obstacles.
  To dynamically regulate the degree of exploration throughout training, we introduce
  a bi-level optimization process that learns a parameter to balance two distinct
  reward signals. We demonstrate that our method enables quadrupedal robots to acquire
  highly agile behaviors—including crawling, climbing, leaping, and complex maneuvers
  such as jumping off vertical walls. Finally, we successfully deploy the learned
  policy on real hardware, validating its transferability to the real world.

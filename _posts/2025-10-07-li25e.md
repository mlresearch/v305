title: 'Learn from What We HAVE: History-Aware VErifier that Reasons about Past Interactions
  Online'
section: Poster
openreview: iWMM4oxMBu
abstract: 'We introduce a novel History-Aware VErifier (HAVE) to disambiguate uncertain
  scenarios online by leveraging past interactions. Robots frequently encounter visually
  ambiguous objects whose manipulation outcomes remain uncertain until physically
  interacted with. While generative models alone could theoretically adapt to such
  ambiguity, in practice they obtain suboptimal performance in ambiguous cases, even
  when conditioned on action history.  To address this, we propose explicitly decoupling
  action generation from verification: we use an unconditional diffusion-based generator
  to propose multiple candidate actions and employ our history-aware verifier to select
  the most promising action by reasoning about past interactions. Through theoretical
  analysis, we demonstrate that employing a verifier significantly improves expected
  action quality. Empirical evaluations and analysis across multiple simulated and
  real-world environments including articulated objects, multi-modal doors, and uneven
  object pick-up confirm the effectiveness of our method and improvements over baselines.'

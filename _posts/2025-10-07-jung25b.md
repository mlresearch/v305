  Processes
section: Poster

abstract: Terrain elevation modeling for off-road navigation aims to accurately estimate
  changes in terrain geometry in real-time and quantify the corresponding uncertainties.
  Having precise estimations and uncertainties plays a crucial role in planning and
  control algorithms to explore safe and reliable maneuver strategies. However, existing
  approaches, such as Gaussian Processes (GPs) and neural network-based methods, often
  fail to meet these needs. They are either unable to perform in real-time due to
  high computational demands, underestimating sharp geometry changes, or harming elevation
  accuracy when learned with uncertainties. Recently, Neural Processes (NPs) have
  emerged as a promising approach that integrates the Bayesian uncertainty estimation
  of GPs with the efficiency and flexibility of neural networks. Inspired by NPs,
  we propose an effective NP-based method that precisely estimates sharp elevation
  changes and quantifies the corresponding predictive uncertainty without losing elevation
  accuracy. Our method leverages semantic features from LiDAR and camera sensors to
  improve interpolation and extrapolation accuracy in unobserved regions. Also, we
  introduce a local ball-query attention mechanism to effectively reduce the computational
  complexity of global attention by 17% while preserving crucial local and spatial
  information. We evaluate our method on off-road datasets having interesting geometric
  features, collected from trails, deserts, and hills. Our results demonstrate superior
  performance over baselines and showcase the potential of neural processes for effective
  and expressive terrain modeling in complex off-road environments.

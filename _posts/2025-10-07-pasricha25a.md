title: Dynamics-Compliant Trajectory Diffusion for Super-Nominal Payload Manipulation
section: Poster
openreview: 8RdxHk9hpr
abstract: Nominal payload ratings for articulated robots are typically derived from
  worst-case configurations, resulting in uniform payload constraints across the entire
  workspace. This conservative approach severely underutilizes the robot’s inherent
  capabilities—our analysis demonstrates that manipulators can safely handle payloads
  well above nominal capacity across broad regions of their workspace while staying
  within joint angle, velocity, acceleration, and torque limits. To address this gap
  between assumed and actual capability, we propose a novel trajectory generation
  approach using denoising diffusion models that explicitly incorporates payload constraints
  into the planning process. Unlike traditional sampling-based methods that rely on
  inefficient trial-and-error, optimization-based methods that are prohibitively slow,
  or kinodynamic planners that struggle with problem dimensionality, our approach
  generates dynamically feasible joint-space trajectories in constant time that can
  be directly executed on physical hardware without post-processing. Experimental
  validation on a 7 DoF Franka Emika Panda robot demonstrates that up to 67.6% of
  the workspace remains accessible even with payloads exceeding 3 times the nominal
  capacity. This expanded operational envelope highlights the importance of a more
  nuanced consideration of payload dynamics in motion planning algorithms.

title: 'AT-Drone: Benchmarking Adaptive Teaming in Multi-Drone Pursuit'
section: Poster
openreview: xPryDEv2YH
abstract: 'Adaptive teaming—the capability of agents to effectively collaborate with
  unfamiliar teammates without prior coordination—is widely explored in virtual video
  games but overlooked in real-world multi-robot contexts. Yet, such adaptive collaboration
  is crucial for real-world applications, including border surveillance, search-and-rescue,
  and counter-terrorism operations. To address this gap, we introduce AT-Drone, the
  first dedicated benchmark explicitly designed to facilitate comprehensive training
  and evaluation of adaptive teaming strategies in multi-drone pursuit scenarios.
  AT-Drone makes the following key contributions: (1) An adaptable simulation environment
  configurator that enables intuitive and rapid setup of adaptive teaming multi-drone
  pursuit tasks, including four predefined pursuit environments. (2) A streamlined
  real-world deployment pipeline that seamlessly translates simulation insights into
  practical drone evaluations using edge devices (such as Jetson Orin Nano) and Crazyflie
  drones. (3) A novel algorithm zoo integrated with a distributed training framework,
  featuring diverse algorithms explicitly tailored, for the first time, to multi-pursuer
  and multi-evader drone pursuit task. (4) Standardized evaluation protocols with
  newly designed unseen drone zoos, explicitly designed to rigorously assess the performance
  of adaptive teaming. Comprehensive experimental evaluations across four progressively
  challenging multi-drone pursuit scenarios confirm AT-Drone’s effectiveness in advancing
  adaptive teaming research. Real-world drone experiments further validate its practical
  feasibility and utility for realistic robotic operations. Videos, code and weights

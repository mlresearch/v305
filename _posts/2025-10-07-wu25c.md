abstract: Mobile manipulation is the fundamental challenge for robotics in assisting
  humans with diverse tasks and environments in everyday life. Conventional mobile
  manipulation approaches often struggle to generalize across different tasks and
  environments due to the lack of large-scale training. However, recent advances in
  manipulation foundation models demonstrate impressive generalization capability
  on a wide range of fixed-base manipulation tasks, which are still limited to a fixed
  setting. Therefore, we devise a plug-in module named MoTo, which can be combined
  with any off-the-shelf manipulation foundation model to empower them with mobile
  manipulation ability. Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware navigation policy
  to generate agent docking points for generalized mobile manipulation.  To enable
  zero-shot ability, we propose an interaction keypoints framework via vision-language
  models (VLM) under multi-view consistency for both target object and robotic arm
  following instructions, where fixed-base manipulation foundation models can be employed.
  We further propose motion planning objectives for the mobile base and robot arm,
  which minimize the distance between the two keypoints and maintain the physical
  feasibility of trajectories. In this way, MoTo guides the agent to move to the docking
  points where fixed-base manipulation can be successfully performed, and leverages
  VLM generation and trajectory optimization to achieve mobile manipulation in a zero-shot
  manner, without any requirement on mobile manipulation expert data. Extensive experimental
  results on OVMM and real-world demonstrate that MoTo achieves success rates of 2.68%
  and 16.67% higher than the state-of-the-art mobile manipulation methods, respectively,
  without requiring additional training data.

title: Articulated Object Estimation in the Wild
section: Poster
openreview: J1Ekhe08QU
abstract: Understanding the 3D motion of articulated objects is essential in robotic
  scene understanding, mobile manipulation, and motion planning. Prior methods for
  articulation estimation have primarily focused on controlled settings, assuming
  either fixed camera viewpoints or direct observations of various object states,
  which tend to fail in more realistic, unconstrained environments. In contrast, humans
  effortlessly infer articulation modes by watching others manipulating objects. Inspired
  by this, we introduce ArtiPoint, a novel estimation framework capable of inferring
  articulated object models under dynamic camera motion and partial observability.
  By combining deep point tracking with a factor graph optimization framework, ArtiPoint
  robustly estimates articulated part trajectories and articulation axes directly
  from raw RGB-D videos. To foster future research in this domain, we introduce Arti4D,
  the first ego-centric in-the-wild dataset capturing articulated object interactions
  at a scene level, accompanied with articulation labels and ground truth camera poses.
  We benchmark ArtiPoint against a range of classical and modern deep learning baselines,
  demonstrating its superior performance on Arti4D. We make our code and Arti4D publicly
  available at redacted-for-review.

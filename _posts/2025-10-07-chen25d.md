title: 'Tool-as-Interface: Learning Robot Policies from Observing Human Tool Use'
section: Poster
openreview: ZA8iXa45P2
abstract: Tool use is essential for enabling robots to perform complex real-world
  tasks, but learning such skills requires extensive datasets. While teleoperation
  is widely used, it is slow, delay-sensitive, and poorly suited for dynamic tasks.
  In contrast, human videos provide a natural way for data collection without specialized
  hardware, though they pose challenges on robot learning due to viewpoint variations
  and embodiment gaps. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that transfers
  tool-use knowledge from humans to robots. To improve the policyâ€™s robustness to
  viewpoint variations, we use two RGB cameras to reconstruct 3D scenes and apply
  Gaussian splatting for novel view synthesis. We reduce the embodiment gap using
  segmented observations and tool-centric, task-space actions to achieve embodiment-invariant
  visuomotor policy learning. Our method achieves a 71% improvement in task success
  and a 77% reduction in data collection time compared to diffusion policies trained
  on teleoperation with equivalent time budgets. Our method also reduces data collection
  time by 41% compared with the state-of-the-art data collection interface.

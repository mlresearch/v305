title: Multi-critic Learning for Whole-body End-effector Twist Tracking
section: Poster
openreview: sVWKm4UiTL
abstract: Learning whole-body control for locomotion and arm motions in a single policy
  has challenges, as the two tasks have conflicting goals. For instance, efficient
  locomotion typically favors a horizontal base orientation, while end-effector tracking
  may benefit from base tilting to extend reachability. Additionally, current Reinforcement
  Learning (RL) approaches using a pose-based task specification lack the ability
  to directly control the end-effector velocity, making smoothly executing trajectories
  very challenging. To address these limitations, we propose an RL-based framework
  that allows for dynamic, velocity-aware whole-body end-effector control. Our method
  introduces a multi-critic actor architecture that decouples the reward signals for
  locomotion and manipulation, simplifying reward tuning and allowing the policy to
  resolve task conflicts more effectively. Furthermore, we design a twist-based end-effector
  task formulation that can track both discrete poses and motion trajectories. We
  validate our approach through a set of simulation and hardware experiments using
  a quadruped robot equipped with a robotic arm. The resulting controller can simultaneously
  walk and move its end-effector and shows emergent whole-body behaviors, where the
  base assists the arm in extending the workspace, despite a lack of explicit formulations.

title: In-Context Iterative Policy Improvement for Dynamic Manipulation
section: Poster
openreview: IV35hjIZwz
abstract: Attention-based architectures trained on internet-scale language data have
  demonstrated state of the art reasoning ability for various language-based tasks,
  such as logic problems and textual reasoning. Additionally, these Large Language
  Models (LLMs) have exhibited the ability to perform few-shot prediction via in-context
  learning, in which input-output examples provided in the prompt are generalized
  to new inputs. This ability furthermore extends beyond standard language tasks,
  enabling few-shot learning for general patterns. In this work, we consider the application
  of in-context learning with pre-trained language models for dynamic manipulation.
  Dynamic manipulation introduces several crucial challenges, including increased
  dimensionality, complex dynamics, and partial observability. To address this, we
  take an iterative approach, and formulate our in-context learning problem to predict
  adjustments to a parametric policy based on previous interactions. We show across
  several tasks in simulation and on a physical robot that utilizing in-context learning
  outperforms alternative methods in the low data regime.

title: 'CogniPlan: Uncertainty-Guided Path Planning with Conditional Generative Layout
  Prediction'
section: Poster
openreview: uA9GZEmGiT
abstract: 'Path planning in unknown environments is a crucial yet inherently challenging
  capability for mobile robots, which primarily encompasses two coupled tasks: autonomous
  exploration and point-goal navigation. In both cases, the robot must perceive the
  environment, update its belief, and accurately estimate potential information gain
  on-the-fly to guide planning. In this work, we propose CogniPlan, a novel path planning
  framework that leverages multiple plausible layouts predicted by a conditional generative
  inpainting model, mirroring how humans rely on cognitive maps during navigation.
  These predictions, based on the partially observed map and a set of layout conditioning
  vectors, enable our planner to reason effectively under uncertainty. We demonstrate
  strong synergy between generative image-based layout prediction and graph-attention-based
  path planning, allowing CogniPlan to combine the scalability of graph representations
  with the fidelity and predictiveness of occupancy maps, yielding notable performance
  gains in both exploration and navigation. We extensively evaluate CogniPlan on two
  datasets (hundreds of maps and realistic floor plans), consistently outperforming
  state-of-the-art planners. We further deploy it in a high-fidelity simulator and
  on hardware, showcasing its high-quality path planning and real-world applicability.'

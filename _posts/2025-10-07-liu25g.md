title: 'PicoPose: Progressive Pixel-to-Pixel Correspondence Learning for Novel Object
  Pose Estimation'
section: Poster
openreview: EXgckdYESp
abstract: RGB-based novel object pose estimation is critical for rapid deployment
  in robotic applications, yet zero-shot generalization remains a key challenge. In
  this paper, we introduce PicoPose, a novel framework designed to tackle this task
  using a three-stage pixel-to-pixel correspondence learning process. Firstly, PicoPose
  matches features from the RGB observation with those from rendered object templates,
  identifying the best-matched template and establishing coarse correspondences. Secondly,
  PicoPose smooths the correspondences by globally regressing a 2D affine transformation,
  including in-plane rotation, scale, and 2D translation, from the coarse correspondence
  map. Thirdly, PicoPose applies the affine transformation to the feature map of the
  best-matched template and learns correspondence offsets within local regions to
  achieve fine-grained correspondences. By progressively refining the correspondences,
  PicoPose significantly improves the accuracy of object poses computed via PnP/RANSAC.
  PicoPose achieves state-of-the-art performance on the seven core datasets of the
  BOP benchmark, demonstrating exceptional generalization to novel objects. Our code
  and models will be made publicly available.

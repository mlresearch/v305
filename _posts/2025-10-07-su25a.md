title: Toward Real-World Cooperative and Competitive Soccer with Quadrupedal Robot
  Teams
section: Poster

abstract: Achieving coordinated teamwork among legged robots requires both fine-grained
  locomotion control and long-horizon strategic decision-making. Robot soccer offers
  a compelling testbed for this challenge, combining dynamic, competitive, and multi-agent
  interactions. In this work, we present a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement
  learning (MARL) framework that enables fully autonomous and decentralized quadruped
  robot soccer. First, a set of highly dynamic low-level skills is trained for legged
  locomotion and ball manipulation, such as walking, dribbling, and kicking. On top
  of these, a high-level strategic planning policy is trained with Multi-Agent Proximal
  Policy Optimization (MAPPO) via Fictitious Self-Play (FSP). This learning framework
  allows agents to adapt to diverse opponent strategies and gives rise to sophisticated
  team behaviors, including coordinated passing, interception, and dynamic role allocation.
  With an extensive ablation study, the proposed learning method shows significant
  advantages in the cooperative and competitive multi-agent soccer game. We deploy
  the learned policies to real quadruped robots relying solely on onboard proprioception
  and decentralized localization, with the resulting system supporting autonomous
  robot-robot and robot-human soccer matches on indoor and outdoor soccer courts.

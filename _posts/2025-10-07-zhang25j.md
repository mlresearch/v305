abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based legged locomotion controllers often require
  meticulous reward tuning to track velocities or goal positions while preserving
  smooth motion on various terrains.  Motion imitation methods via RL using demonstration
  data reduce reward engineering but fail to generalize to novel environments.  We
  address this by proposing a hierarchical RL framework in which a low-level policy
  is first pre-trained to imitate animal motions on flat ground, thereby establishing
  motion priors. A subsequent high-level, goal-conditioned policy then builds on these
  priors, learning residual corrections that enable perceptive locomotion, local obstacle
  avoidance, and goal-directed navigation across diverse and rugged terrains. Simulation
  experiments illustrate the effectiveness of learned residuals in adapting to progressively
  challenging uneven terrains while still preserving the locomotion characteristics
  provided by the motion priors. Furthermore, our results demonstrate improvements
  in motion regularization over baseline models trained without motion priors under
  similar reward setups.  Real-world experiments with an ANYmal-D quadruped robot
  confirm our policyâ€™s capability to generalize animal-like locomotion skills to complex
  terrains, demonstrating smooth and efficient locomotion and local navigation performance
  amidst challenging terrains with obstacles.

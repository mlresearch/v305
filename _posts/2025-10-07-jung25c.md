title: 'ImLPR: Image-based LiDAR Place Recognition using Vision Foundation Models'
section: Poster
openreview: O2RGlBfR9H
abstract: LiDAR Place Recognition (LPR) is a key component in robotic localization,
  enabling robots to align current scans with prior maps of their environment. While
  Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has embraced Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance
  descriptor robustness, LPR has relied on task-specific models with limited use of
  pre-trained foundation-level knowledge. This is due to the lack of 3D foundation
  models and the challenges of using VFM with LiDAR point clouds. To tackle this,
  we introduce ImLPR, a novel pipeline that employs a pre-trained DINOv2 VFM to generate
  rich descriptors for LPR. To our knowledge, ImLPR is the first method to leverage
  a VFM to support LPR. ImLPR converts raw point clouds into Range Image Views (RIV)
  to leverage VFM in the LiDAR domain. It employs MultiConv adapters and Patch-InfoNCE
  loss for effective feature learning. We validate ImLPR using public datasets where
  it outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in intra-session and inter-session
  LPR with top Recall@1 and F1 scores across various LiDARs. We also demonstrate that
  RIV outperforms Birdâ€™s-Eye-View (BEV) as a representation choice for adapting LiDAR
  for VFM. We release ImLPR as open source for the robotics community.

title: 'Vision in Action: Learning Active Perception from Human Demonstrations'
section: Poster
openreview: 1NBdplgILy
abstract: We present Vision in Action (ViA), an active perception system for bimanual
  robot manipulation. ViA learns task-relevant active perceptual strategies (e.g.,
  searching, tracking, and focusing) directly from human demonstrations. On the hardware
  side, ViA employs a simple yet effective 6-DoF robotic neck to enable flexible,
  human-like head movements. To capture human active perception strategies, we design
  a VR-based teleoperation interface that creates a shared observation space between
  the robot and the human operator. To mitigate VR motion sickness caused by latency
  in the robot’s physical movements, the interface uses an intermediate 3D scene representation,
  enabling real-time view rendering on the operator side while asynchronously updating
  the scene with the robot’s latest observations. Together, these design elements
  enable the learning of robust visuomotor policies for three complex, multi-stage
  bimanual manipulation tasks involving visual occlusions, significantly outperforming
  baseline systems.

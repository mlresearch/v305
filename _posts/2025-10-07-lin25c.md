title: Sim-to-Real Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Based Dexterous Manipulation
  on Humanoids
section: Poster
openreview: 8DHSyMFLbB
abstract: 'Learning generalizable robot manipulation policies, especially for complex
  multi-fingered humanoids, remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches primarily
  rely on extensive data collection and imitation learning, which are expensive, labor-intensive,
  and difficult to scale. Sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising
  alternative, but has mostly succeeded in simpler state-based or single-hand setups.
  How to effectively extend this to vision-based, contact-rich bimanual manipulation
  tasks remains an open question. In this paper, we introduce a practical sim-to-real
  RL recipe that trains a humanoid robot to perform three challenging dexterous manipulation
  tasks: grasp-and-reach, box lift and bimanual handover. Our method features an automated
  real-to-sim tuning module, a generalized reward formulation based on contact and
  object goals, a divide-and-conquer policy distillation framework, and a hybrid object
  representation strategy with modality-specific augmentation. We demonstrate high
  success rates on unseen objects and robust, adaptive policy behaviors â€“ highlighting
  that vision-based dexterous manipulation via sim-to-real RL is not only viable,
  but also scalable and broadly applicable to real-world humanoid manipulation tasks.'

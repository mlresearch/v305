title: 'Multi-Loco: Unifying Multi-Embodiment Legged Locomotion via Reinforcement
  Learning Augmented Diffusion'
section: Poster
openreview: ypDETG94BS
abstract: Generalizing locomotion policies across diverse legged robots with varying
  morphologies is a key challenge due to differences in observation/action dimensions
  and system dynamics. In this work, we propose \textit{Multi-Loco}, a novel unified
  framework combining a morphology-agnostic generative diffusion model with a lightweight
  residual policy optimized via reinforcement learning (RL). The diffusion model captures
  morphology-invariant locomotion patterns from diverse cross-embodiment datasets,
  improving generalization and robustness. The residual policy is shared across all
  embodiments and refines the actions generated by the diffusion model, enhancing
  task-aware performance and robustness for real-world deployment. We evaluated our
  method with a rich library of four legged robots in both simulation and real-world
  experiments. Compared to a standard RL framework with PPO, our approach - replacing
  the Gaussian policy with a diffusion model and residual term - achieves a 10.35%
  average return improvement, with gains up to 13.57% in wheeled-biped locomotion
  tasks. These results highlight the benefits of cross-embodiment data and composite
  generative architectures in learning robust, generalized locomotion skills.

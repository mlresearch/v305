title: 'GLOVER++: Unleashing the Potential of Affordance Learning from Human Behaviors
  for Robotic Manipulation'
section: Poster
openreview: HT34hQcU91
abstract: 'Learning manipulation skills from human demonstration videos offers a promising
  path toward generalizable and interpretable robotic intelligenceâ€”particularly through
  the lens of *actionable affordances*.  However, transferring such knowledge remains
  challenging due to:  1) a lack of large-scale datasets with precise affordance annotations,
  and 2) insufficient exploration of affordances in diverse manipulation contexts.
  To address these gaps, we introduce **HOVA-500K**, a large-scale, affordance-annotated
  dataset comprising 500,000 images across 1,726 object categories and 675 actions.
  We also release a standardized benchmarking suite for multi-modal affordance reasoning.
  Built upon HOVA-500K, we present **GLOVER++**, a *global-to-local* affordance training
  framework that effectively transfers actionable affordance knowledge from human
  demonstrations to downstream open-vocabulary reasoning tasks. GLOVER++ achieves
  state-of-the-art results on the HOVA-500K benchmark and demonstrates strong generalization
  across diverse downstream robotic manipulation tasks.  By explicitly modeling actionable
  affordances, GLOVER++ facilitates robust transfer across scenes, modalities, and
  tasks. We hope that HOVA-500K and the GLOVER++ framework will serve as valuable
  resources for bridging the gap between human demonstrations and robotic manipulation
  capabilities. We will release our dataset, code and models.'

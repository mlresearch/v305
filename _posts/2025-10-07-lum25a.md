title: Crossing the Human-Robot Embodiment Gap with Sim-to-Real RL using One Human
  Demonstration
section: Poster
openreview: CgGSFtjplI
abstract: 'Teaching robots dexterous manipulation skills often requires collecting
  hundreds of demonstrations using wearables or teleoperation, a process that is challenging
  to scale. Videos of human-object interactions are easier to collect and scale, but
  leveraging them directly for robot learning is difficult due to the lack of explicit
  action labels and human-robot embodiment differences. We propose Human2Sim2Robot,
  a novel real-to-sim-to-real framework for training dexterous manipulation policies
  using only one RGB-D video of a human demonstrating a task. Our method utilizes
  reinforcement learning (RL) in simulation to cross the embodiment gap without relying
  on wearables, teleoperation, or large-scale data collection. From the video, we
  extract: (1) the object pose trajectory to define an object-centric, embodiment-agnostic
  reward, and (2) the pre-manipulation hand pose to initialize and guide exploration
  during RL training. These components enable effective policy learning without any
  task-specific reward tuning. In the single human demo regime, Human2Sim2Robot outperforms
  object-aware replay by over 55% and imitation learning by over 68% on grasping,
  non-prehensile manipulation, and multi-step tasks. Website: https://human2sim2robot.github.io'

title: Improving Efficiency of Sampling-based Motion Planning via Message-Passing
  Monte Carlo
section: Poster
openreview: bi8o9p6h2R
abstract: Sampling-based motion planning methods, while effective in high-dimensional
  spaces, often suffer from inefficiencies due to irregular sampling distributions,
  leading to suboptimal exploration of the configuration space. In this paper, we
  propose an approach that enhances the efficiency of these methods by utilizing low-discrepancy
  distributions generated through Message-Passing Monte Carlo (MPMC). MPMC leverages
  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generate point sets that uniformly cover the space,
  with uniformity assessed using the the $\mathcal{L}_p$-discrepancy measure, which
  quantifies the irregularity of sample distributions. By improving the uniformity
  of the point sets, our approach significantly reduces computational overhead and
  the number of samples required for solving motion planning problems. Experimental
  results demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional sampling techniques
  in terms of planning efficiency.

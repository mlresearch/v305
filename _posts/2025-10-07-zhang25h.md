title: Robust Dexterous Grasping of General Objects
section: Poster
openreview: SNvUSjVm6C
abstract: The ability to robustly grasp a variety of objects is essential for dexterous
  robots. In this paper, we present a framework for zero-shot dynamic dexterous grasping
  using single-view visual inputs, designed to be resilient to various disturbances.
  Our approach utilizes a hand-centric object shape representation based on dynamic
  distance vectors between finger joints and object surfaces. This representation
  captures the local shape around potential contact regions rather than focusing on
  detailed global object geometry, thereby enhancing generalization to shape variations
  and uncertainties. To address perception limitations, we integrate a privileged
  teacher policy with a mixed curriculum learning approach, allowing the student policy
  to effectively distill grasping capabilities and explore for adaptation to disturbances.
  Trained in simulation, our method achieves success rates of 97.0% across 247,786
  simulated objects and 94.6% across 512 real objects, demonstrating remarkable generalization.
  Quantitative and qualitative results validate the robustness of our policy against
  various disturbances.
